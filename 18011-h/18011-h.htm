<h3 align="center">Chapter I</h3>

<p>On the west side of Ellen's father's house was a file of Norway
spruce-trees, standing with a sharp pointing of dark boughs towards
the north, which gave them an air of expectancy of progress.</p>

<p>Every morning Ellen, whose bedroom faced that way, looked out with
a firm belief that she would see them on the other side of the stone
wall, advanced several paces towards their native land. She had no
doubt of their ability to do so; their roots, projecting in fibrous
sprawls from their trunks, were their feet, and she pictured them
advancing with wide trailings, and rustlings as of green draperies,
and a loudening of that dreamy cry of theirs which was to her
imagination a cry of homesickness reminiscent of their old life in
the White north. When Ellen had first heard the name Norway spruce,
'way back in her childhood&mdash;so far back, though she was only
seven and a half now, that it seemed to her like a memory from
another life&mdash;she had asked her mother to show her Norway on the
map, and her strange convictions concerning the trees had seized her.
When her mother said that they had come from that northernmost land
of Europe, Ellen, to whose childhood all truth was naked and literal,
immediately conceived to herself those veritable trees advancing over
the frozen seas around the pole, and down through the vast regions
which were painted blue on her map, straight to her father's west
yard. There they stood and sang the songs of their own country, with
a melancholy sweetness of absence and longing, and were forever
thinking to return. Ellen felt always a thrill of happy surprise when
she saw them still there of a morning, for she felt that she would
miss them sorely when they were gone. She said nothing of all this to
her mother; it was one of the secrets of the soul which created her
individuality and made her a spiritual birth. She was also silent
about her belief concerning the cherry-trees in the east yard. There
were three of them, giants of their kind, which filled the east yard
every spring as with mountains of white bloom, breathing wide gusts
of honey sweetness, and humming with bees. Ellen believed that these
trees had once stood in the Garden of Eden, but she never expected to
find them missing from the east yard of a morning, for she remembered
the angel with the flaming sword, and she knew how one branch of the
easternmost tree happened to be blasted as if by fire. And she
thought that these trees were happy, and never sighed to the wind as
the dark evergreens did, because they had still the same blossoms and
the same fruit that they had in Eden, and so did not fairly know that
they were not there still. Sometimes Ellen, sitting underneath them
on a low rib of rock on a May morning, used to fancy with success
that she and the trees were together in that first garden which she
had read about in the Bible.</p>

<p>Sometimes, after one of these successful imaginings, when Ellen's
mother called her into the house she would stare at her little
daughter uneasily, and give her a spoonful of a bitter spring
medicine which she had brewed herself. When Ellen's father, Andrew
Brewster, came home from the shop, she would speak to him aside as he
was washing his hands at the kitchen sink, and tell him that it
seemed to her that Ellen looked kind of &ldquo;pindlin'.&rdquo;  Then
Andrew, before he sat down at the dinner-table, would take Ellen's
face in his two moist hands, look at her with anxiety thinly veiled
by facetiousness, rub his rough, dark cheek against her soft, white
one until he had reddened it, then laugh, and tell her she looked
like a bo'sn. Ellen never quite knew what her father meant by bo'sn,
but she understood that it signified something very rosy and hearty
indeed.</p>

<p>Ellen's father always picked out for her the choicest and
tenderest bits of the humble dishes, and his keen eyes were more
watchful of her plate than of his own. Always after Ellen's mother
had said to her father that she thought Ellen looked pindling he was
late about coming home from the shop, and would turn in at the gate
laden with paper parcels. Then Ellen would find an orange or some
other delicacy beside her plate at supper. Ellen's aunt Eva, her
mother's younger sister, who lived with them, would look askance at
the tidbit with open sarcasm. &ldquo;You jest spoil that young one,
Fanny,&rdquo; she would say to her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do jest as you are a mind to with your own young
ones when you get them, but you can let mine alone. It's none of your
business what her father and me give her to eat; you don't buy
it,&rdquo; Ellen's mother would retort. There was the utmost
frankness of speech between the two sisters. Neither could have been
in the slightest doubt as to what the other thought of her, for it
was openly proclaimed to her a dozen times a day, and the conclusion
was never complimentary. Ellen learned very early to form her own
opinions of character from her own intuition, otherwise she would
have held her aunt and mother in somewhat slighting estimation, and
she loved them both dearly. They were headstrong, violent-tempered
women, but she had an instinct for the staple qualities below that
surface turbulence, which was lashed higher by every gust of
opposition. These two loud, contending voices, which filled the house
before and after shop-hours&mdash;for Eva worked in the shop with her
brother-in-law&mdash;with a duet of discords instead of harmonies,
meant no more to Ellen than the wrangle of the robins in the
cherry-trees. She supposed that two sisters always conversed in that
way. She never knew why her father, after a fiery but ineffectual
attempt to quell the feminine tumult, would send her across the east
yard to her grandmother Brewster's, and seat himself on the east
door-step in summer, or go down to the store in the winter. She would
sit at the window in her grandmother's sitting-room, eating
peacefully the slice of pound-cake or cooky with which she was always
regaled, and listen to the scolding voices across the yard as she
might have listened to any outside disturbance. She was never sucked
into the whirlpool of wrath which seemed to gyrate perpetually in her
home, and wondered at her grandmother Brewster's impatient
exclamations concerning the poor child, and her poor boy, and that it
was a shame and a disgrace, when now and then a louder explosion of
wrath struck her ears.</p>

<p>Ellen's grandmother&mdash;Mrs. Zelotes Brewster, as she was
called, though her husband Zelotes had been dead for many
years&mdash;was an aristocrat by virtue of inborn prejudices and
convictions, in despite of circumstances. The neighbors said that
Mrs. Zelotes Brewster had always been high-feeling, and had held up
her head with the best. It would have been nearer the truth to say
that she held up her head above the best. No one seeing the erect old
woman, in her draperies of the finest black goods to be bought in the
city, could estimate in what heights of thin upper air of spiritual
consequence her head was elevated. She had always a clear sight of
the head-tops of any throng in which she found herself, and queens or
duchesses would have been no exception. She would never have failed
to find some stool of superior possessions or traits upon which to
raise herself, and look down upon crown and coronet. When she read in
the papers about the marriage of a New York belle to an English duke,
she reflected that the duke could be by no means as fine a figure of
a man as Zelotes had been, and as her son Andrew was, although both
her husband and son had got all their education in the town schools,
and had worked in shoe-shops all their lives. She could have looked
at a palace or a castle, and have remained true to the splendors of
her little one-story-and-a-half house with a best parlor and
sitting-room, and a shed kitchen for use in hot weather.</p>

<p>She would not for one instant have been swerved from utmost
admiration and faith in her set of white-and-gold wedding china by
the contemplation of Copeland and Royal S&egrave;vres. She would have
pitted her hair-cloth furniture of the ugliest period of household
art against all the Chippendales and First Empire pieces in
existence.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Zelotes had never seen any household possessions to equal
her own, let alone to surpass them, she was of the same mind with
regard to her husband and his family, herself and her family, her son
and little granddaughter. She never saw any gowns and shawls which
compared with hers in fineness and richness; she never tasted a
morsel of cookery which was not as sawdust when she reflected upon
her own; and all that humiliated her in the least, or caused her to
feel in the least dissatisfied, was her son's wife and her family and
antecedents.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes Brewster had considered that her son Andrew was
marrying immeasurably beneath him when he married Fanny Loud, of
Loudville. Loudville was a humble, an almost disreputably humble,
suburb of the little provincial city. The Louds from whom the
locality took its name were never held in much repute, being
considered of a stratum decidedly below the ordinary social one of
the city. When Andrew told his mother that he was to marry a Loud,
she declared that she would not go to his wedding, nor receive the
girl at her house, and she kept her word. When one day Andrew brought
his sweetheart to his home to call, trusting to her pretty face and
graceful though rather sharp manner to win his mother's heart, he
found her intrenched in the kitchen, and absolutely indifferent to
the charms of his Fanny in her stylish, albeit somewhat tawdry,
finery, though she had peeped to good purpose from her parlor window,
which commanded the road, before she fled kitchenward.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes was beating eggs with as firm an impetus as if she
were heaving up earth-works to strengthen her own pride when her son
thrust his timid face into the kitchen. &ldquo;Mother, Fanny's in the
parlor,&rdquo; he said, beseechingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her set there, then, if she wants to,&rdquo; said his
mother, and that was all she would say.</p>

<p>Very soon Fanny went home on her lover's arm, freeing her mind
with no uncertain voice on the way, though she was on the public
road, and within hearing of sharp ears in open windows. Fanny had a
pride as fierce as Mrs. Zelotes Brewster's, though it was not so well
sustained, and she would then and there have refused to marry Andrew
had she not loved him with all her passionate and ill-regulated
heart. But she never forgave her mother-in-law for the slight she had
put upon her that day, and the slights which she put upon her later.
She would have refused to live next door to Mrs. Zelotes had not
Andrew owned the land and been in a measure forced to build there.
Every time she had flaunted out of her new house-door in her wedding
finery she had an uncomfortable feeling of defiance under a fire of
hostile eyes in the next house. She kept her own windows upon that
side as clear and bright as diamonds, and her curtains in the
stiffest, snowy slants, lest her terrible mother-in-law should have
occasion to impeach her housekeeping, she being a notable housewife.
The habits of the Louds of Loudville were considered shiftless in the
extreme, and poor Fanny had heard an insinuation of Mrs. Zelotes to
that effect.</p>

<p>The elder Mrs. Brewster's knowledge of her son's house and his
wife was limited to the view from her west windows, but there was
half-truce when little Ellen was born. Mrs. Brewster, who considered
that no woman could be obtained with such a fine knowledge of nursing
as she possessed, and who had, moreover, a regard for her poor boy's
pocket-book, appeared for the first time in his doorway, and opened
her heart to her son's child, if not to his wife, whom she began to
tolerate.</p>

<p>However, the two women had almost a hand-to-hand encounter over
little Ellen's cradle, the elder Mrs. Brewster judging that it was
for her good to be rocked to sleep, the younger not. Little Ellen
herself, however, turned the balance that time in favor of her
grandmother, since she cried every time the gentle, swaying motion
was hushed, and absolutely refused to go to sleep, and her mother
from the first held every course which seemed to contribute to her
pleasure and comfort as a sacred duty. At last it came to pass that
the two women met only upon that small neutral ground of love, and
upon all other territory were sworn foes. Especially was Mrs. Zelotes
wroth when Eva Loud, after the death of her father, one of the most
worthless and shiftless of the Louds of Loudville, came to live with
her married sister. She spoke openly to Fanny concerning her opinion
of another woman's coming to live on poor Andrew, and paid no heed to
the assertions that Eva would work and pay her way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes, although she acknowledged it no social degradation
for a man to work in a shoe-factory, regarded a woman who worked
therein as having hopelessly forfeited her caste. Eva Loud had worked
in a shop ever since she was fourteen, and had tagged the grimy and
leathery procession of Louds, who worked in shoe-factories when they
worked at all, in a short skirt with her hair in a strong black
pigtail. There was a kind of bold grace and showy beauty about this
Eva Loud which added to Mrs. Zelotes's scorn and dislike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She walks off to work in the shop as proud as if she was
going to a party,&rdquo; she said, and she fairly trembled with anger
when she saw the girl set out with her son in the morning. She would
have considered it much more according to the eternal fitness of
things had her son Andrew been attending a queen whom he would have
dropped at her palace on the way. She writhed inwardly whenever
little Ellen spoke of her aunt Eva, and would have forbidden her to
do so had she dared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of that child associating with a shop-girl!&rdquo;
she said to Mrs. Pointdexter. Mrs. Pointdexter was her particular
friend, whom she regarded with loving tolerance of superiority,
though she had been the daughter of a former clergyman of the town,
and had wedded another, and might presumably have been accounted
herself of a somewhat higher estate. The gentle and dependent
clergyman's widow, when she came back to her native city after the
death of her husband, found herself all at once in a pleasant little
valley of humiliation at the feet of her old friend, and was
contented to abide there. &ldquo;Perhaps your son's sister-in-law
will marry and go away,&rdquo; she said, consolingly, to Mrs.
Zelotes, who indeed lived in that hope. But Eva remained at her
sister's, and, though she had admirers in plenty, did not marry, and
the dissension grew.</p>

<p>It was an odd thing that, however the sisters quarrelled, the
minute Andrew tried to take sides with his wife and assail Eva in his
turn, Fanny turned and defended her. &ldquo;I am not going to desert
all the sister I have got in the world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If
you want me to leave, say so, and I will go, but I shall never turn
Eva out of doors. I would rather go with her and work in the
shop.&rdquo;  Then the next moment the wrangle would recommence, and
the harsh trebles of wrath would swell high. Andrew could not
appreciate this savageness of race loyalty in the face of anger and
dissension, and his brain reeled with the apparent inconsistency of
the thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think they are both crazy,&rdquo; he used to
tell his mother, who sympathized with him after a covertly triumphant
fashion. She never said, &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; but the thought
was evident on her face, and her son saw it there.</p>

<p>However, he said not a word against his wife, except by
implication. Though she and her sister were making his home
unbearable, he still loved her, and, even if he did not, he had
something of his mother's pride.</p>

<p>However, at last, when Ellen was almost eight years old, matters
came suddenly to a climax one evening in November. The two sisters
were having a fiercer dispute than usual. Eva was taking her sister
to task for cutting over a dress of hers for Ellen, Fanny claiming
that she had given her permission to do so, and Eva denying it. The
child sat listening in her little chair with a look of dawning
intelligence of wrath and wicked temper in her face, because she was
herself in a manner the cause of the dissension. Suddenly Andrew
Brewster, with a fiery outburst of inconsequent masculine wrath with
the whole situation, essayed to cut the Gordian knot. He grabbed the
little dress of bright woollen stuff, which lay partly made upon the
table, and crammed it into the stove, and a reek of burning wool
filled the room. Then both women turned upon him with a combination
of anger to which his wrath was wildfire.</p>

<p>Andrew caught up little Ellen, who was beginning to look scared,
wrapped the first thing he could seize around her, and fairly fled
across the yard to his mother's. Then he sat down and wept like a
boy, and his pride left him at last. &ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; he
sobbed, &ldquo;if it were not for the child, I would go away, for my
home is a hell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes stood clasping little Ellen, who clung to her,
trembling. &ldquo;Well, come over here with me,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;you and Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Live here in the next house!&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;Do
you suppose Fanny would have the child living under her very eyes in
the next house? No, there is no way out of the misery&mdash;no way;
but if it was not for the child, I would go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew burst out in such wild sobs that his mother released Ellen
and ran to him; and the child, trembling and crying with a curious
softness, as of fear at being heard, ran out of the house and back to
her home. &ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; she cried, breaking in upon the
dialogue of anger which was still going on there with her little
tremulous flute&mdash;&ldquo;oh, mother, father is crying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; answered her mother, fiercely, her
temper causing her to lose sight of the child's agitation. &ldquo;I
don't care. If it wasn't for you, I would leave him. I wouldn't live
as I am doing. I would leave everybody. I am tired of this awful
life. Oh, if it wasn't for you, Ellen, I would leave everybody and
start fresh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can leave <em>me</em> whenever you want to,&rdquo; said
Eva, her handsome face burning red with wrath, and she went out of
the room, which was suffocating with the fumes of the burning wool,
tossing her black head, all banged and coiled in the latest
fashion.</p>

<p>Of late years Fanny had sunk her personal vanity further and
further in that for her child. She brushed her own hair back hard
from her temples, and candidly revealed all her unyouthful lines, and
dwelt fondly upon the arrangement of little Ellen's locks, which were
of a fine, pale yellow, as clear as the color of amber.</p>

<p>She never recut her skirts or her sleeves, but she studied
anxiously all the slightest changes in children's fashions. After her
sister had left the room with a loud bang of the door, she sat for a
moment gazing straight ahead, her face working, then she burst into
such a passion of hysterical wailing as the child had never heard.
Ellen, watching her mother with eyes so frightened and full of horror
that there was no room for childish love and pity in them, grew very
pale. She had left the door by which she had entered open; she gazed
one moment at her mother, then she turned and slipped out of the
room, and, opening the outer door softly, though her mother would not
have heard nor noticed, went out of the house.</p>

<p>Then she ran as fast as she could down the frozen road, a little,
dark figure, passing as rapidly as the shadow of a cloud between the
earth and the full moon.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter II</h3>

<p>The greatest complexity in the world attends the motive-power of
any action. Infinite perspectives of mental mirrors reflect the whys
of all doing. An adult with long practice in analytic introspection
soon becomes bewildered when he strives to evolve the primary and
fundamental reasons for his deeds; a child so striving would be lost
in unexpected depths; but a child never strives. A child obeys
unquestioningly and absolutely its own spiritual impellings without a
backward glance at them.</p>

<p>Little Ellen Brewster ran down the road that November night, and
did not know then, and never knew afterwards, why she ran. Loving
renunciation was surging high in her childish heart, giving an
indication of tidal possibilities for the future, and there was also
a bitter, angry hurt of slighted dependency and affection. Had she
not heard them say, her own mother and father say, that they would be
better off and happier with her out of the way, and she their dearest
loved and most carefully cherished possession in the whole world? It
is a cruel fall for an apple of the eye to the ground, for its law of
gravitation is of the soul, and its fall shocks the infinite. Little
Ellen felt herself sorely hurt by her fall from such fair heights;
she was pierced by the sharp thorns of selfish interests which
flourish below all the heavenward windows of life.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when her mother and father tried to make her tell them
why she ran away, she could not say; the answer was beyond her own
power.</p>

<p>There was no snow on the ground, but the earth was frozen in great
ribs after a late thaw. Ellen ran painfully between the ridges which
a long line of ice-wagons had made with their heavy wheels earlier in
the day. When the spaces between the ridges were too narrow for her
little feet, she ran along the crests, and that was precarious. She
fell once and bruised one of her delicate knees, then she fell again,
and struck the knee on the same place. It hurt her, and she caught
her breath with a gasp of pain. She pulled up her little frock and
touched her hand to her knee, and felt it wet, then she whimpered on
the lonely road, and, curiously enough, there was pity for her mother
as well as for herself in her solitary grieving. &ldquo;Mother would
feel pretty bad if she knew how I was hurt, enough to make it
bleed,&rdquo; she murmured, between her soft sobs. Ellen did not dare
cry loudly, from a certain unvoiced fear which she had of shocking
the stillness of the night, and also from a delicate sense of
personal dignity, and a dislike of violent manifestations of feeling
which had strengthened with her growth in the midst of the turbulent
atmosphere of her home. Ellen had the softest childish voice, and she
never screamed or shouted when excited. Instead of catching the
motion of the wind, she still lay before it, like some
slender-stemmed flower. If Ellen had made much outcry with the hurt
in her heart and the smart of her knee, she might have been heard,
for the locality was thickly settled, though not in the business
portion of the little city. The houses, set prosperously in the midst
of shaven lawns&mdash;for this was a thrifty and emulative place, and
democracy held up its head confidently&mdash;were built closely along
the road, though that was lonely and deserted at that hour. It was
the hour between half-past six and half-past seven, when people were
lingering at their supper-tables, and had not yet started upon their
evening pursuits. The lights shone for the most part from the rear
windows of the houses, and there was a vague compound odor of tea and
bread and beefsteak in the air. Poor Ellen had not had her supper;
the wrangle at home had dismissed it from everybody's mind. She felt
more pitiful towards her mother and herself when she smelt the food
and reflected upon that. To think of her going away without any
supper, all alone in the dark night! There was no moon, and the
solemn brilliancy of the stars made her think with a shiver of awe of
the Old Testament and the possibility of the Day of Judgment. Suppose
it should come, and she all alone out in the night, in the midst of
all those worlds and the great White Throne, without her mother?
Ellen's grandmother, who was of a stanch orthodox breed, and was,
moreover, anxious to counteract any possible detriment as to
religious training from contact with the degenerate Louds of
Loudville, had established a strict course of Bible study for her
granddaughter at a very early age. All celestial phenomena were in
consequence transposed into a Biblical key for the child, and she
regarded the heavens swarming with golden stars as a Hebrew child of
a thousand years ago might have done.</p>

<p>She was glad when she came within the radius of a street light
from time to time; they were stationed at wide intervals in that
neighborhood. Soon, however, she reached the factories, when all
mystery and awe, and vague terrors of what beside herself might be
near unrevealed beneath the mighty brooding of the night, were over.
She was, as it were, in the mid-current of the conditions of her own
life and times, and the material force of it swept away all
symbolisms and unstable drift, and left only the bare rocks and
shores of existence. Always when the child had been taken by one of
her elders past the factories, humming like gigantic hives, with
their windows alert with eager eyes of toil, glancing out at her over
bench and machine, Ellen had seen her secretly cherished imaginings
recede into a night of distance like stars, and she had felt her
little footing upon the earth with a shock, and had clung more
closely to the leading hand of love. &ldquo;That's where your poor
father works,&rdquo; her grandmother would say. &ldquo;Maybe you'll
have to work there some day,&rdquo; her aunt Eva had said once; and
her mother, who had been with her also, had cried out sharply as if
she had been stung, &ldquo;I guess that little delicate thing ain't
never goin' to work in a shoe-shop, Eva Loud.&rdquo;  And her aunt
Eva had laughed, and declared with emphasis that she guessed there
was no need to worry yet awhile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never shall, while I live,&rdquo; her mother had cried;
and then Eva, coming to her sister's aid against her own suggestion,
had declared, with a vehemence which frightened Ellen, that she would
burn the shop down herself first.</p>

<p>As for Ellen's father, he never at that time dwelt upon the
child's future as much as his wife did, having a masculine sense of
the instability of houses of air which prevented him from entering
them without a shivering of walls and roof into naught but
star-mediums by his downrightness of vision. &ldquo;Oh, let the child
be, can't you, Fanny?&rdquo; he said, when his wife speculated
whether Ellen would be or do this or that when she should be a woman.
He resented the conception of the woman which would swallow up, like
some metaphysical sorceress, his fair little child. So when he now
and then led Ellen past the factories it was never with the slightest
surmise as to any connection which she might have with them beyond
the present one. &ldquo;There's the shop where father works,&rdquo;
he would tell Ellen, with a tender sense of his own importance in his
child's eyes, and he was as proud as Punch when Ellen was able to
point with her tiny pink finger at the window where father worked.
&ldquo;That's where father works and earns money to buy nice things
for little Ellen,&rdquo; Andrew would repeat, beaming at her with
divine foolishness, and Ellen looked at the roaring, vibrating
building as she might have looked at the wheels of progress. She
realized that her father was very great and smart to work in a place
like that, and earn money&mdash;so much of it. Ellen often heard her
mother remark with pride how much money Andrew earned.</p>

<p>To-night, when Ellen passed in her strange flight, the factories
were still, though they were yet blazing with light. The gigantic
buildings, after a style of architecture as simple as a child's block
house, and adapted to as primitive an end, loomed up beside the road
like windowed shells enclosing massive concretenesses of golden
light. They looked entirely vacant except for light, for the workmen
had all gone home, and there were only the keepers in the buildings.
There were three of them, representing three different firms, rival
firms, grouped curiously close together, but Lloyd's was much the
largest. Andrew and Eva worked in Lloyd's.</p>

<p>She was near the last factory when she met a man hastening along
with bent shoulders, of intent, middle-aged progress. After he had
passed her with a careless glance at the small, swift figure, she
smelt coffee. He was carrying home a pound for his breakfast supply.
That suddenly made her cry, though she did not know why. That
familiar odor of home and the wontedness of life made her isolation
on her little atom of the unusual more pitiful. The man turned round
sharply when she sobbed. &ldquo;Hullo! what's the matter, sis?&rdquo;
he called back, in a pleasant, hoarse voice. Ellen did not answer;
she fled as if she had wings on her feet. The man had many children
of his own, and was accustomed to their turbulence over trifles. He
kept on, thinking that there was a sulky child who had been sent on
an errand against her will, that it was not late, and she was safe
enough on that road. He resumed his calculation as to whether his
income would admit of a new coal-stove that winter. He was a workman
in a factory, with one accumulative interest in
life&mdash;coal-stoves. He bought and traded and swapped coal-stoves
every winter with keenest enthusiasm. Now he had one in his mind
which he had just viewed in a window with the rapture of an artist.
It had a little nickel statuette on the top, and that quite crowded
Ellen out of his mind, which had but narrow accommodations.</p>

<p>So Ellen kept on unmolested, though her heart was beating loud
with fright. When she came into the brilliantly lighted stretch of
Main Street, which was the business centre of the city, her childish
mind was partly diverted from herself. Ellen had not been down town
many times of an evening, and always in hand of her hurrying father
or mother. Now she had run away and cut loose from all restrictions
of time; there was an eternity for observation before her, with no
call in-doors in prospect. She stopped at the first bright shop
window, and suddenly the exultation of freedom was over the child.
She tasted the sweets of rebellion and disobedience. She had stood
before that window once before of an evening, and her aunt Eva had
been with her, and one of her young men friends had come up behind,
and they had gone on, the child dragging backward at her aunt's hand.
Now she could stand as long as she wished, and stare and stare, and
drink in everything which her childish imagination craved, and that
was much. The imagination of a child is often like a voracious maw,
seizing upon all that comes within reach, and producing spiritual
indigestions and assimilations almost endless in their effects upon
the growth. This window before which Ellen stood was that of a
market: a great expanse of plate-glass framing a crude study in the
clearest color tones. It takes a child or an artist to see a picture
without the intrusion of its second dimension of sordid use and the
gross reflection of humanity.</p>

<p>Ellen looked at the great shelf laid upon with flesh and
vegetables and fruits with the careless precision of a kaleidoscope,
and did not for one instant connect anything thereon with the ends of
physical appetite, though she had not had her supper. What had a meal
of beefsteak and potatoes and squash served on the little white-laid
table at home to do with those great golden globes which made one end
of the window like the remove from a mine, those satin-smooth
spheres, those cuts as of red and white marble? She had eaten apples,
but these were as the apples of the gods, lying in a heap of
opulence, with a precious light-spot like a ruby on every outward
side. The turnips affected her imagination like ivory carvings: she
did not recognize them for turnips at all. She never afterwards
believed them to be turnips; and as for cabbages, they were green
inflorescences of majestic bloom. There is one position from which
all common things can be seen with reflections of preciousness, and
Ellen had insensibly taken it. The window and the shop behind were
illuminated with the yellow glare of gas, but the glass was filmed
here and there with frost, which tempered it as with a veil. In the
background rosy-faced men in white frocks were moving to and fro,
customers were passing in and out, but they were all glorified to the
child. She did not see them as butchers, and as men and women selling
and buying dinners.</p>

<p>However, all at once everything was spoiled, for her fairy castle
of illusion or a higher reality was demolished, and that not by any
blow of practicality, but by pity and sentiment. Ellen was a
woman-child, and suddenly she struck the rock upon which women so
often wreck or effect harbor, whichever it may be. All at once she
looked up from the dazzling mosaic of the window and saw the dead
partridges and grouse hanging in their rumpled brown mottle of
plumage, and the dead rabbits, long and stark, with their fur pointed
with frost, hanging in a piteous headlong company, and all her
delight and wonder vanished, and she came down to the hard
actualities of things. &ldquo;Oh, the poor birds!&rdquo; she cried
out in her heart. &ldquo;Oh, the poor birds, and the poor
bunnies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just at that moment, when the sudden rush of compassion and
indignation had swollen her heart to the size of a woman's, and given
it the aches of one, when her eyes were so dilated with the sight of
helpless injury and death that they reflected the mystery of it and
lost the outlook of childhood, when her pretty baby mouth was curved
like an inverted bow of love with the impulse of tears, Cynthia
Lennox came up the street and stopped short when she reached her.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ellen felt some one pressing close to her, and, looking
up, saw a woman, only middle-aged, but whom she thought very old,
because her hair was white, standing looking at her very keenly with
clear, light-blue eyes under a high, pale forehead, from which the
gray hair was combed uncompromisingly back. The woman had been a
beauty once, of a delicate, nervous type, and had a certain beauty
now, a something which had endured like the fineness of texture of a
web when its glow of color has faded. Her black garments draped her
with sober richness, and there was a gleam of dark fur when the wind
caught her cloak. A small tuft of ostrich plumes nodded from her
bonnet. Ellen smelt flowers vaguely, and looked at the lady's hand,
but she did not carry any.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose little girl are you?&rdquo; Cynthia Lennox asked,
softly, and Ellen did not answer. &ldquo;Can't you tell me whose
little girl you are?&rdquo;  Cynthia Lennox asked again. Ellen did
not speak, but there was the swift flicker of a thought over her face
which told her name as plainly as language if the woman had possessed
the skill to interpret it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen Brewster&mdash;Ellen Brewster is my name,&rdquo;
Ellen said to herself very hard, and that was how she endured the
reproach of her own silence.</p>

<p>The woman looked at her with surprise and admiration that were
fairly passionate. Ellen was a beautiful child, with a face like a
white flower. People had always turned to look after her, she was so
charming, and had caused her mothers heart to swell with pride.
&ldquo;The way everybody we met has stared after that child
to-day!&rdquo; she would whisper her husband when she brought Ellen
home from some little expedition; then the two would look at the
little one's face with the one holy vanity of the world. Ellen wore
to-night the little white shawl which her father had caught up when
he carried her over to her grandmother's. She held it tightly
together under her chin with one tiny hand, and her face looked out
from between the soft folds with the absolute purity of curve and
color of a pearl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you darling!&rdquo; said the woman, suddenly;
&ldquo;you darling!&rdquo; and Ellen shrank away from her.
&ldquo;Don't be afraid, dear,&rdquo; said Cynthia Lennox.
&ldquo;Don't be afraid, only tell me who you are. What is your name,
dear?&rdquo;  But Ellen remained silent; only, as she shrank aloof,
her eyes grew wild and bright with startled tears, and her sweet baby
mouth quivered piteously. She wanted to run, but the habit of
obedience was so strong upon her little mind that she feared to do
so. This strange woman seemed to have gotten her in some invisible
leash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what your name is, darling,&rdquo; said the woman,
but she might as well have importuned a flower. Ellen was proof
against all commands in that direction. She suddenly felt the furry
sweep of the lady's cloak against her cheek, and a nervous, tender
arm drawing her close, though she strove feebly to resist. &ldquo;You
are cold, you have nothing on but this little white shawl, and
perhaps you are hungry. What were you looking in this window for?
Tell me, dear, where is your mother? She did not send you on an
errand, such a little girl as you are, so late on such a cold night,
with no more on than this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tone of indignation crept into the lady's voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother didn't send me,&rdquo; Ellen said, speaking for
the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then did you run away, dear?&rdquo;  Ellen was silent.
&ldquo;Oh, if you did, darling, you must tell me where you live, what
your father's name is, and I will take you home. Tell me, dear. If it
is far, I will get a carriage, and you shall ride home. Tell me,
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an utmost sweetness of maternal persuasion in Cynthia
Lennox's voice; Ellen was swayed by it as a child might have been
swayed by the magic pipe of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. She half
yielded to her leading motion, then she remembered. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
she cried out, with a sob of utter desolation. &ldquo;No,
no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don't want; they don't want. No, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don't want you? Your own father and mother don't want
you? Darling, what is the matter?&rdquo;  But Ellen was dumb again.
She stood sobbing, with a painful restraint, and pulling futilely
from the lady's persuasive hand. But it ended in the mastery of the
child. Suddenly Cynthia Lennox gathered her up in her arms under her
great fur-lined cloak, and carried her a little farther down the
street, then across it to a dwelling-house, one of the very few which
had withstood the march of business blocks on this crowded main
street of the provincial city. A few people looked curiously at the
lady carrying such a heavy, weeping child, but she met no one whom
she knew, and the others looked indifferently away after a second
backward stare. Cynthia Lennox was one to bear herself with such
dignity over all jolts of circumstances that she might almost
convince others of her own exemption from them. Her mental bearing
disproved the evidence of the senses, and she could have committed a
crime with such consummate self-poise and grace as to have held a
crowd in abeyance with utter distrust of their own eyes before such
unquestioning confidence in the sovereignty of the situation. Cynthia
Lennox had always had her own way except in one respect, and that
experience had come to her lately.</p>

<p>Though she was such a slender woman, she seemed to have great
strength in her arms, and she bore Ellen easily and as if she had
been used to such a burden. She wrapped her cloak closely around the
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be afraid, darling,&rdquo; she kept whispering. Ellen
panted in bewilderment, and a terror which was half assuaged by
something like fascination.</p>

<p>She was conscious of a soft smother of camphor, in which the
fur-lined cloak had lain through the summer, and of that flower odor,
which was violets, though she did not know it. Only the wild American
scentless ones had come in little Ellen's way so far.</p>

<p>She felt herself carried up steps, then a door was thrown open,
and a warm breath of air came in her face, and the cloak was tossed
back, and she was set softly on the floor. The hall in which she
stood seemed very bright; she blinked and rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>The lady stood over her, laughing gently, and when the child
looked up at her, seemed much younger than she had at first, very
young in spite of her white hair. There was a soft red on her cheek;
her lips looked full and triumphant with smiles; her eyes were like
stars. An emotion of her youth which had never become dulled by
satisfaction had suddenly blossomed out on her face, and transformed
it. An unassuaged longing may serve to preserve youth as well as an
undestroyed illusion; indeed, the two are one. Cynthia Lennox looked
at the child as if she had been a young mother, and she her
first-born; triumph over the future, and daring for all odds, and
perfect faith in the kingdom of joy were in her look. Had she nursed
one child like Ellen to womanhood, and tasted the bitter in the cup,
she would not have been capable of that look, and would have been as
old as her years. She threw off her cloak and took off her bonnet,
and the light struck her hair and made it look like silver. A brooch
in the laces at her throat shone with a thousand hues, and as Ellen
gazed at it she felt curiously dull and dizzy. She did not resist at
all when the lady removed her little white shawl, but stared at her
with the look of some small and helpless thing in too large a grasp
of destiny to admit of a struggle. &ldquo;Oh, you darling!&rdquo;
Cynthia Lennox said, and stooped and kissed her, and half carried her
into a great, warm, dazzling room, with light reflected in long lines
of gold from picture-frames on the wall, and now and then startling
patches of lurid color blazing forth unmeaningly from the dark
incline of their canvases, with gleams of crystal and shadows of
bronze in settings of fretted ebony, with long swayings of rich
draperies at doors and windows, a red light of fire in a grate, and
two white lights, one of piano keys, the other of a flying marble
figure in a corner, outlined clearly against dusky red. The light in
this room was very dim. It was all beyond Ellen's imagination. The
White North where the Norway spruces lived would not have seemed as
strange to her as this. Neither would Bluebeard's Castle, nor the
House that Jack Built, nor the Palace of King Solomon, nor the tent
in which lived little Joseph in his coat of many colors, nor even the
Garden of Eden, nor Noah's Ark. Her imagination had not prepared her
for a room like this. She had formed her ideas of rooms upon her
grandmother's and her mother's and the neighbors' best parlors, with
their glories of crushed plush and gilt and onyx and cheap lace and
picture-throws and lambrequins. This room was such a heterodoxy
against her creed of civilization that it did not look beautiful to
her as much as strange and bewildering, and when she was bidden to
sit down in a little inlaid precious chair she put down her tiny hand
and reflected, with a sense of strengthening of her household faith,
that her grandmother had beautiful, smooth, shiny hair-cloth.</p>

<p>Cynthia Lennox pulled the chair close to the fire, and bade her
hold out her little feet to the blaze to warm them well. &ldquo;I am
afraid you are chilled, darling,&rdquo; she said, and looked at her
sitting there in her dainty little red cashmere frock, with her
spread of baby-yellow hair over her shoulders. Then Ellen thought
that the lady was younger than her mother; but her mother had borne
her and nursed her, and suffered and eaten of the tree of knowledge,
and tasted the bitter after the sweet; and this other woman was but
as a child in the garden, though she was fairly old. But along with
Ellen's conviction of the lady's youth had come a conviction of her
power, and she yielded to her unquestioningly. Whenever she came near
her she gazed with dilating eyes upon the blazing circle of diamonds
at her throat.</p>

<p>When she was bidden, she followed the lady into the dining-room,
where the glitter of glass and silver and the soft gleam of precious
china made her think for a little while that she must be in a store.
She had never seen anything like this except in a store, when she had
been with her mother to buy a lamp-chimney. So she decided this to be
a store, but she said nothing. She did not speak at all, but she ate
her biscuits, and slice of breast of chicken, and sponge-cake, and
drank her milk.</p>

<p>She had her milk in a little silver cup which seemed as if it
might have belonged to another child; she also sat in a small
high-chair, which made it seem as if another child had lived or
visited in the house. Ellen became singularly possessed with this
sense of the presence of a child, and when the door opened she would
look around for her to enter, but it was always an old black woman
with a face of imperturbable bronze, which caused her to huddle
closer into her chair when she drew near.</p>

<p>There were not many colored people in the city, and Ellen had
never seen any except at Long Beach, where she had sometimes gone to
have a shore dinner with her mother and Aunt Eva. Then she always
used to shrink when the black waiter drew near, and her mother and
aunt would be convulsed with furtive mirth. &ldquo;See the little
gump,&rdquo; her mother would say in the tenderest tone, and look
about to see if others at the other tables saw how cunning she
was&mdash;what a charming little goose to be afraid of a colored
waiter.</p>

<p>Ellen saw nobody except the lady and the black woman, but she was
still sure that there was a child in the house, and after supper,
when she was taken up-stairs to bed, she peeped through every open
door with the expectation of seeing her.</p>

<p>But she was so weary and sleepy that her curiosity and capacity
for any other emotion was blunted. She had become simply a little,
tired, sleepy animal. She let herself be undressed; she was not even
moved to much self-pity when the lady discovered the cruel bruise on
her delicate knee, and kissed it, and dressed it with a healing
salve. She was put into a little night-gown which she knew dreamily
belonged to that other child, and was laid in a little bedstead which
she noted to be made of gold, with floating lace over the head.</p>

<p>She sleepily noted, too, that there were flowers on the walls, and
more floating lace over the bureau. This room did not look so strange
to her as the others; she had somehow from the treasures of her fancy
provided the family of big bears and little bears with a similar one.
Then, too, one of the neighbors, Mrs. George Crocker, had read many
articles in women's papers relative to the beautifying of homes, and
had furnished a wonderful chamber with old soap-boxes and rolls of
Japanese paper which was a sort of a cousin many times removed of
this. When she was in bed the lady kissed her, and called her
darling, and bade her sleep well, and not be afraid, she was in the
next room, and could hear if she spoke. Then she stood looking at
her, and Ellen thought that she must be younger than Minnie Swensen,
who lived on her street, and wore a yellow pigtail, and went to the
high-school. Then she closed her heavy eyes, and forgot to cry about
her poor father and mother; still, there was, after all, a hurt about
them down in her childish heart, though a great wave of new
circumstances had rolled on her shore and submerged for the time her
memory and her love, even, she was so feeble and young.</p>

<p>She slept very soundly, and awoke only once, about two o'clock in
the morning. Then a passing lantern flashed into the chamber into her
eyes, and woke her up, but she only sighed and stretched drowsily,
then turned her little body over with a luxurious roll and went to
sleep again.</p>

<p>It was poor Andrew Brewster's lantern which flashed in her eyes,
for he was out with a posse of police and sympathizing neighbors and
friends searching for his lost little girl. He was frantic, and when
he came under the gas-lights from time to time the men that saw him
shuddered; they would not have known him, for almost the farthest
agony of which he was capable had changed his face.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter III</h3>

<p>By the next morning all the city was in a commotion over little
Ellen's disappearance. Woods on the outskirts were being searched,
ponds were being dragged, posters with a stare of dreadful meaning in
large characters of black and white were being pasted all over the
fences and available barns, and already three of the local editors
had been to the Brewster house to obtain particulars and photographs
of the missing child for reproduction in the city papers.</p>

<p>The first train from Boston brought two reporters representing
great dailies.</p>

<p>Fanny Brewster, white-cheeked, with the rasped redness of tears
around her eyes and mouth, clad in her blue calico wrapper, received
them in her best parlor. Eva had made a fire in the best parlor stove
early that morning. &ldquo;Folks will be comin' in all day, I
expect,&rdquo; said she, speaking with nervous catches of her breath.
Ever since the child had been missed, Eva's anxiety had driven her
from point to point of unrest as with a stinging lash. She had pelted
bareheaded down the road and up the road; she had invaded all the
neighbors' houses, insisting upon looking through their farthest and
most unlikely closets; she had even penetrated to the woods, and
joined wild-eyed the groups of peering workers on the shore of the
nearest pond. That she could not endure long, so she had rushed home
to her sister, who was either pacing her sitting-room with
inarticulate murmurs and wails of distress in the sympathizing ears
of several of the neighboring women, or else was staring with haggard
eyes of fearful hope from a window. When she looked from the eastern
window she could see her mother-in-law, Mrs. Zelotes Brewster, at an
opposite one, sitting immovable, with her Bible in her lap, prayer in
her heart, and an eye of grim holding to faith upon the road for the
fulfilment of promise. She felt all her muscles stiffen with anger
when she saw the wild eyes of the child's mother at the other window.
&ldquo;It is all her fault,&rdquo; she said to
herself&mdash;&ldquo;all her fault&mdash;hers and that bold trollop
of a sister of hers.&rdquo;  When she saw Eva run down the road, with
her black hair rising like a mane to the morning wind, she was an
embodiment of an imprecatory psalm. When, later on, she saw the three
editors coming&mdash;Mr. Walsey, of <cite>The Spy</cite>, and Mr.
Jones, of <cite>The Observer</cite>, and young Joe Bemis, of
<cite>The Star</cite>, on his bicycle&mdash;she watched jealously to
see if they were admitted. When Fanny's head disappeared from the
eastern window she knew that Eva had let them in and Fanny was
receiving them in the parlor. &ldquo;She will tell them all about the
words they had last night, that made the dear child run away,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;All the town will know what doings there are in
our family.&rdquo;  Mrs. Zelotes made up her mind to a course of
action. Each editor was granted a long audience with Fanny and Eva,
who entertained them with hysterical solemnity and displayed Ellen's
photographs in the red plush album, from the last, taken in her best
white frock, to one when she was three weeks old, and seeming weakly
and not likely to live. This had been taken by a photographer
summoned to the house at great expense. &ldquo;Her father has never
spared expense for Ellen,&rdquo; said Fanny, with an outburst of
grief. &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;I'll testify to
that. Andrew Brewster never thought anything was too good for that
young one.&rdquo;  Then she burst out with a sob louder than her
sister's. Eva had usually a coarsely well-kempt appearance, her heavy
black hair being securely twisted, and her neck ribbons tied with
smart jerks of neatness; but to-day her hair was still in the fringy
braids of yesterday, and her cotton blouse humped untidily in the
back. Her face was red and her lips swollen; she looked like a very
bacchante of sorrow, and as if she had been on some mad orgy of
grief.</p>

<p>Mr. Walsey, of <cite>The Spy</cite>, who had formerly conducted a
paper in a college town and was not accustomed to the feminine
possibilities of manufacturing localities, felt almost afraid of her.
He had never seen a woman of that sort, and thought vaguely of the
French Revolution and fish-wives when she gave vent to her distress
over the loss of the child. He fairly jumped when she cut short a
question of his with a volley of self-recriminatory truths,
accompanied with fierce gesturing. He stood back involuntarily out of
reach of those powerful, waving arms. &ldquo;Do I know of any reason
for the child to run away?&rdquo; shrieked Eva, in a voice shrilly
hideous with emotion, now and then breaking into hoarseness with the
strain of tears. &ldquo;I guess I know why, I guess I do, and I wish
I had been six foot under ground before I did what I did. It was all
my fault, every bit of it. When I got home, and found that Fan had
been making that precious young one a dress out of my old blue one, I
pitched into her for it, and she gave it back to me, and then we
jawed, and kept it up, till Andrew, he grabbed the dress and flung it
into the fire, and did just right, too, and took Ellen and run over
to old lady Brewster's with her; then Ellen, she see him cryin', and
it scared her 'most to death, poor little thing, and she heard him
say that if it wasn't for her he'd quit, and then she come runnin'
home to her mother and me, and her mother said the same thing, and
then that poor young one, she thought she wa'n't wanted nowheres, and
she run. She always was as easy to hurt as a baby robin; it didn't
take nothing to set her all of a flutter and a twitter; and now she's
just flown out of the nest. Oh my God, I wish my tongue had been torn
out by the roots before I'd said a word about her blessed little
dress; I wish Fan had cut up every old rag I've got; I'd go dressed
in fig-leaves before I'd had it happen. Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Joe Bemis, of <cite>The Star</cite>, was the first to leave,
whirling madly and precariously down the street on his wheel, which
was dizzily tall in those days. Mrs. Zelotes, hailing him from her
open window, might as well have hailed the wind. Her family
dissensions were well aired in <cite>The Star</cite> next morning,
and she always kept the cutting at the bottom of a little rosewood
work-box where she stored away divers small treasures, and never
looked at the box without a swift dart of pain as from a hidden sting
and the consciousness as of the presence of some noxious insect caged
therein.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes was more successful in arresting the progress of the
other editors, and (standing at the window, her Bible on the little
table at her side) flatly contradicted all that had been told them by
her daughter-in-law and her sister. &ldquo;The Louds always give way,
no matter what comes up. You can always tell what kind of a family
anybody comes from by the way they take things when anything comes
across them. You can't depend on anything she says this morning. My
son did not marry just as I wished; everybody knows that; the Louds
weren't equal to our family, and everybody knows it, and I have never
made any secret as to how I felt, but we have always got along well
enough. The Brewsters are not quarrelsome; they never have been.
There were no words whatever last night to make my granddaughter run
away. Eva and Fanny are all wrong about it. Ellen has been stolen; I
know it as well as if I had seen it. A strange-looking woman came to
the door yesterday afternoon; she was the tallest woman I ever saw,
and she took the widest steps; she measured her dress skirt every
step she took, and she spoke gruff. I said then I knew she was a man
dressed up. Ellen was playing out in the yard, and she saw the child
as she went out, and I see her stoop and look at her real sharp, and
my blood run kind of cold then, and I called Ellen away as quick as I
could; and the woman, she turned round and gave me a look that I
won't ever forget as long as I live. My belief is that that woman was
laying in wait when Ellen was going across the yard home from here
last night, and she has got her safe somewhere till a reward is
offered. Or maybe she wants to keep her, Ellen is such a beautiful
child. You needn't put in your papers that my grandchild run away
because of quarrelling in our family, because she didn't. Eva and
Fanny don't know what they are talking about, they are so wrought up;
and, coming from the family they do, they don't know how to control
themselves and show any sense. I feel it as much as they do, but I
have been sitting here all the morning; I know I can't do anything to
help, and I am working a good deal harder, waiting, than they are,
rushing from pillar to post and taking on, and I'm doing more good. I
shall be the only one fit to do anything when they find the poor
child. I've got blankets warming by the fire, and my tea-kettle on,
and I'm going to be the one to depend on when she's brought
home.&rdquo;  Mrs. Zelotes gave a glance of defiant faith from the
window down the road as she spoke. Then she settled back in her chair
and resumed her Bible, and dismissed the tall and forbidding woman
whom she had summoned to save the honor of her family resolutely from
her conscience. The editors of <cite>The Spy</cite> and <cite>The
Observer</cite> had a row of ingratiating photographs of little Ellen
from three weeks to seven years of age; and their opinions as to the
cause of her disappearance, while fully agreeing in all points of
sensationalism with those of young Bemis, of <cite>The Star</cite>,
differed in detail.</p>

<p>Young Bemis read about the mysterious kidnapper, and wondered, and
the demand for <cite>The Star</cite> was chiefly among the immediate
neighbors of the Brewsters. Both <cite>The Observer</cite> and
<cite>The Spy</cite> doubled their circulation in one day, and every
face on the night cars was hidden behind poor little Ellen's baby
countenances and the fairy-story of the witch-woman who had lured her
away. Mothers kept their children carefully in-doors that evening,
and pulled down curtains, fearful lest She look in the windows and be
tempted. Mrs. Zelotes also waylaid both of the Boston reporters, but
with results upon which she had not counted. One presented her story
and Fanny's and Eva's with impartial justice; the other kept wholly
to the latter version, with the addition of a shrewd theory of his
own, deduced from the circumstances which had a parallel in actual
history, and boldly stated that the child had probably committed
suicide on account of family troubles. Poor Fanny and Eva both saw
that, when night was falling and Ellen had not been found. Eva rushed
out and secured the paper from the newsboy, and the two sisters
gasped over the startling column together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a lie! oh, Fanny, it's a lie!&rdquo; cried Eva.
&ldquo;She never would; oh, she never would! That little thing, just
because she heard you and me scoldin', and you said that to her, that
if it wasn't for her you'd go away. She never would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away?&rdquo; sobbed Fanny&mdash;&ldquo;go away? I
wouldn't go away from hell if she was there. I would burn; I would
hear the clankin' of chains, and groans, and screeches, and devils
whisperin' in my ears what I had done wrong, for all eternity, before
I'd go where they were playin' harps in heaven, if she was there. I'd
like it better, I would. And I'd stay here if I had twenty sisters I
didn't get along with, and be happier than I would be anywhere else
on earth, if she was here. But she couldn't have done it. She didn't
know how. It's awful to put such things into papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva jumped up with a fierce gesture, ran to the stove, and crammed
the paper in. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I wish I could
serve all the papers in the country the same way. I do, and I'd like
to put all the editors in after 'em. I'd like to put 'em in the stove
with their own papers for kindlin's.&rdquo;  Suddenly Eva turned with
a swish of skirts, and was out of the room and pounding up-stairs,
shaking the little house with every step. When she returned she bore
over her arm her best dress&mdash;a cherished blue silk, ornate with
ribbons and cheap lace. &ldquo;Where's that pattern?&rdquo; she asked
her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn't ever do such a thing,&rdquo; moaned Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's that pattern?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What pattern?&rdquo; Fanny said, faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That little dress pattern. Her little dress pattern, the
one you cut over my dress for her by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the bureau drawer in my room. Oh, she
wouldn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva went into the bedroom, returned with the pattern, got the
scissors from Fanny's work-basket, and threw her best silk dress in a
rustling heap upon the table.</p>

<p>Fanny stopped moaning and looked at her with wretched wonder.
&ldquo;What be you goin' to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; cried Eva, fiercely&mdash;&ldquo;do? I'm goin'
to cut this dress over for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I be. If I drove her away from home, scoldin' because
you cut over that other old thing of mine for her, I'm goin' to make
up for it now. I'm goin' to give her my best blue silk, that I paid a
dollar and a half a yard for, and 'ain't worn three times. Yes, I be.
She's goin' to have a dress cut out of it, an' she's comin' back to
wear it, too. You'll see she is comin' home to wear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva cut wildly into the silk with mad slashes of her gleaming
shears, while two neighboring women, who had just come into the room,
stared aghast, and even Fanny was partly diverted from her
sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's crazy,&rdquo; whispered one of the women, backing
away as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Eva, don't; don't do so,&rdquo; pleaded Fanny,
tremulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I be,&rdquo; said Eva, and she cut recklessly up the front
breadth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain't cutting it right,&rdquo; said the other neighbor,
who was skilful in such matters, and never fully moved from her own
household grooves by any excitement. &ldquo;If you are a-goin' to cut
it at all, you had better cut it right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care how I cut it,&rdquo; returned Eva, thrusting
the woman away. &ldquo;Oh, I don't care how I cut it; I want to waste
it. I will waste it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other neighbor backed entirely out of the room, then turned
and fled across the yard, her calico wrapper blowing wildly and
lashing about her slender legs, to her own house, the doors of which
she locked. Presently the other woman followed her, stepping with the
ponderous leisure which results from vastness of body and philosophy
of mind. The autumn wind, swirling in impetuous gusts, had little
effect upon her broadside of woollen shawl. She had not come out on
that raw evening with nothing upon her head. She shook the kitchen
door of her friend, and smiled with calm reassurance when it was
cautiously set ajar to disclose a wide-eyed and open-mouthed face of
terror. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's me. What have you got your door locked for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that Eva Loud is raving crazy. I'm afraid of
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord! you 'ain't no reason to be 'fraid of her. She ain't
crazy. She's only lettin' the birds that fly over your an' my heads
settle down to roost. You and me, both of us, if we was situated jest
as she is, might think of doin' jest what she's a-doin', but we won't
neither of us do it. We'd let our best dresses hang in the closet,
safe and sound, while we cut them up in our souls; but Eva, she's
different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't care. I believe she's crazy, and I'm going to
keep my doors locked. How do you know she hasn't killed Ellen and put
her in the well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff! Now you're lettin' your birds roost, Hattie
Monroe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I read something that wasn't any worse than that in the
paper the other day. I should think they would look in the well. Have
Mrs. Jones and Miss Cross gone home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they are over there. There's poor Andrew coming now; I
wonder if he has heard anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both women eyed hesitatingly poor Andrew Brewster's dejected
figure creeping up the road in the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You holler and ask him,&rdquo; said the woman in the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to, for I know by his looks he 'ain't heard anything
of her. I know he's jest comin' home to rest a minute, so he can
start again. I know he 'ain't eat a thing since last night. Well,
Maria has got some coffee all made, and a nice little piece of steak
ready to cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You holler and ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the use? Just see the way he walks; I know without
askin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, as Andrew neared his house he involuntarily quickened his
pace, and his head and shoulders became suddenly alert. It had
occurred to him that possibly Fanny and Eva might have had some news
of Ellen during his absence. Possibly she might have come home
even.</p>

<p>Then he was hailed by the stout woman standing at the door of the
next house. &ldquo;Heard anything yet, Andrew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew shook his head, and looked with despairing eyes at the
windows where he used to see Ellen's little face. She had not come,
then, for these women would have known it. He entered the house, and
Fanny greeted him with a tremulous cry. &ldquo;Have you heard
anything; oh, have you heard anything, Andrew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva sprang forward and clutched him by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p>

<div align="center">

alt="Eva sprang forward and clutched him by the arm"></a>
</div>

<p>Andrew shook his head, and moved her hand from his arm, and pushed
past her roughly.</p>

<p>Fanny stood in his way, and threw her arms around him with a wild,
sobbing cry, but he pushed her away also with sternness, and went to
the kitchen sink to wash his hands. The four women&mdash;his wife,
her sister, and the two neighbors&mdash;stood staring at him; his
face was terrible as he dipped the water from the pail on the sink
corner, and the terribleness of it was accentuated by the homely and
every-day nature of his action.</p>

<p>They all stared, then Fanny burst out with a loud and desperate
wail. &ldquo;He won't speak to me, he pushes me away, when it is our
child that's lost&mdash;his as well as mine. He hasn't any feelings
for me that bore her. He only thinks of himself. Oh, oh, my own
husband pushes me away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew went on washing his hands and his ghastly face, and made no
reply. He had actually at that moment not the slightest sympathy with
his wife. All his other outlets of affection were choked by his
concern for his lost child; and as for pity, he kept reflecting, with
a cold cruelty, that it served her right&mdash;it served both her and
her sister right. Had not they driven the child away between
them?</p>

<p>He would not eat the supper which the neighbors had prepared for
him; finally he went across the yard to his mother's. It seemed to
him at that time that his mother could enter into his state of mind
better than any one else.</p>

<p>When he went out, Fanny called after him, frantically, &ldquo;Oh,
Andrew, you ain't going to leave me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he made no response, she gazed for a second at his retreating
back, then her temper came to her aid. She caught her sister's arm,
and pulled her away out of the kitchen. &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo;
she said, hoarsely. &ldquo;I've got nobody but you. My own husband
leaves me when he is in such awful trouble, and goes to that old
woman, that has always hated me, for comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sisters went into Fanny's bedroom, and sat down on the edge of
the bed, with their arms round each other. &ldquo;Oh, Fanny!&rdquo;
sobbed Eva; &ldquo;poor, poor Fanny! if Andrew turns against you, I
will stand by you as long as I live. I will work my fingers to the
bone to support you and Ellen. I will never get married. I will stay
and work for you and her. And I will never get mad with you again as
long as I live, Fanny. Oh, it was all my fault, every bit my fault,
but, but&mdash;&rdquo;  Eva's voice broke; suddenly she clasped her
sister tighter, and then she went down on her knees beside the bed,
and hid her tangled head in her lap. &ldquo;Oh, Fanny,&rdquo; she
sobbed out miserably, &ldquo;there ain't much excuse for me, but
there's a little. When Jim Tenny stopped goin' with me last summer,
my heart 'most broke. I don't care if you do know it. That's what
made me so much worse than I used to be. Oh, my heart 'most broke,
Fanny! He's treated me awful, but I can't get over it; and now little
Ellen's gone, and I drove her away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny bent over her sister, and pressed her head close to her
bosom. &ldquo;Don't you feel so bad, Eva,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You
wasn't any more to blame than I was, and we'll stand by each other as
long as we live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll work my fingers to the bone for you and Ellen, and
I'll never get married,&rdquo; said Eva again.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter IV</h3>

<p>Ellen Brewster was two nights and a day at Cynthia Lennox's, and
no one discovered it. All day the searching-parties passed the house.
Once Ellen was at the window, and one of the men looked up and saw
her, and since his solicitude for the lost child filled his heart
with responsiveness towards all childhood, he waved his hand and
nodded, and bade another man look at that handsome little kid in the
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess she's about Ellen's size,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn't wonder if she looked something like her,&rdquo;
said the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answers the description well enough,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;same light hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both of the men waved their hands to Ellen as they passed on, but
she shrank back afraid. That was about ten o'clock of the morning of
the day after Miss Lennox had taken her into her house. She had waked
at dawn with a full realization of the situation. She remembered
perfectly all that had happened. She was a child for whom there were
very few half-lights of life, and no spiritual twilights connected
her sleeping and waking hours. She opened her eyes and looked around
the room, and remembered how she had run away and how her mother was
not there, and she remembered the strange lady with that same odd
combination of terror and attraction and docility with which she had
regarded her the night before. It was a very cold morning, and there
was a delicate film of frost on the windows between the sweeps of the
muslin curtains, and the morning sun gave it a rosy glow and a
crusting sparkle as of diamonds. The sight of the frost had broken
poor Andrew Brewster's heart when he saw it, and reflected how it
might have meant death to his little tender child out under the
blighting fall of it, like a little house-flower.</p>

<p>Ellen lay winking at it when Cynthia Lennox came into the room and
leaned over her. The child cast a timid glance up at the tall,
slender figure clad in a dressing-gown of quilted crimson silk which
dazzled her eyes, accustomed as she was to morning wrappers of
dark-blue cotton at ninety-eight cents apiece; and she was filled
with undefined apprehensions of splendor and opulence which might
overwhelm her simple grasp of life and cause her to lose all her old
standards of value.</p>

<p>She had always thought her mother's wrappers very beautiful, but
now look at this! Cynthia's face, too, in the dim, rosy light, looked
very fair to the child, who had no discernment for those ravages of
time of which adults either acquit themselves or by which they
measure their own. She did not see the faded color of the woman's
face at all; she did not see the spreading marks around mouth and
eyes, or the faint parallels of care on the temples; she saw only
that which her unbiased childish vision had ever sought in a human
face, love and kindness, and tender admiration of herself; and her
conviction of its beauty was complete. But at the same time a bitter
and piteous jealousy for her mother and home, and all that she had
ever loved and believed in, came over her. What right had this
strange woman, dressed in a silk dress like that, to be leaning over
her in the morning, and looking at her like that&mdash;to be leaning
over her in the morning instead of her own mother, and looking at her
in that way, when she was not her mother? She shrank away towards the
other side of the bed with that nestling motion which is the natural
one of all young and gentle children even towards vacancy, but
suddenly Cynthia was leaning close over her, and she was conscious
again of that soft smother of violets, and Cynthia's arms were
embracing all her delicate little body with tenderest violence,
folding her against the soft red silk over her bosom, and kissing her
little, blushing cheeks with the lightest and carefulest kisses, as
though she were a butterfly which she feared to harm with her adoring
touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you darling, you precious darling!&rdquo; whispered
Cynthia. &ldquo;Don't be afraid, darling; don't be afraid, precious;
you are very safe; don't be afraid. You shall have such a little,
white, new-laid egg for your breakfast, and some slices of toast,
such a beautiful brown, and some honey. Do you love honey, sweet? And
some chocolate, all in a little pink-and-gold cup which you shall
have for your very own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my mother!&rdquo; Ellen cried out suddenly, with an
exceedingly bitter and terrified and indignant cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, darling!&rdquo; Cynthia whispered;
&ldquo;there is a beautiful red-and-green parrot down-stairs in a
great cage that shines like gold, and you shall have him for your
own, and he can talk. You shall have him for your very own,
sweetheart. Oh, you darling! you darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen felt herself overborne and conquered by this tide of love,
which compelled like her mother's, though this woman was not her
mother, and her revolt of loyalty was subdued for the time. After
all, whether we like it or not, love is somewhat of an impersonal
quality to all children, and perhaps to their elders, and it may be
in such wise that the goddess is evident.</p>

<p>She did not shrink from Cynthia any more then, but suffered her to
lift her out of bed as if she were a baby and set her on a white fur
rug, into which her feet sank, to her astonishment. Her mother had
only drawn-in rugs, which Ellen had watched her make. She was a
little afraid of the fur rug.</p>

<p>Ellen was very small, and seemed much younger than she was by
reason of her baby silence and her little clinging ways. Then, too,
she had always been so petted at home, and through never going to
school had not been in contact with other children. Often the bloom
of childhood is soonest rubbed off by friction with its own kind.
Diamond cut diamond holds good in many cases.</p>

<p>Cynthia did not think she was more than six years old, and never
dreamed of allowing her to dress herself, and indeed the child had
always been largely assisted in so doing. Cynthia washed her and
dressed her, and curled her hair, and led her down-stairs into the
dining-room of the night before, which Ellen still regarded with wise
eyes as the store. Then she sat in the tall chair which must have
been vacated by that mysterious other child, and had her breakfast,
eating her new-laid egg, which the black woman broke for her, while
she leaned delicately away as far as she could with a timid shrug of
her little shoulder, and sipping her chocolate out of the beautiful
pink-and-gold cup. That, however, Ellen decided within herself was
not nearly as pretty as one with &ldquo;A Gift of Friendship&rdquo;
on it in gilt letters which her grandmother kept on the whatnot in
her best parlor. This had been given to her aunt Ellen, who died when
she was a young girl, and was to be hers when she grew up. She did
not care as much for the egg and toast either as for the
griddle-cakes and maple syrup at home. All through breakfast Cynthia
talked to her, and in such manner as the child had never heard. That
fine voice, full of sweetest modulations and cadences, which used the
language with the precision of a musician, was as different from the
voices at home with their guttural slurs and maimed terminals as the
song of a spring robin from the scream of the parrot which Ellen
could hear in some distant room. And what Cynthia said was as
different from ordinary conversation to the child as a fairy tale,
being interspersed with terms of endearment which her mother and
grandmother would have considered high-flown, and have been
shamefaced in employing, and full of a whimsical playfulness which
had an undertone of pathos in it. Cynthia was not still for a minute,
and seemed to feel that much of her power lay in her speech and
voice, like some enchantress who cast her spell by means of her
silver tongue. Nobody knew how she dreaded that outcry of Ellen's,
&ldquo;I want my mother!&rdquo;  It gave her the sensations of a
murderess, even while she persisted in her crime. So she talked,
diverting the child's mind from its natural channel by sheer force of
eloquence. She told a story about the parrot, which caused Ellen's
eyes to widen with thoughtful wonder; she promised her treasures and
pleasures which made her mouth twitch into smiles in spite of
herself; but with all her efforts, when after breakfast they went
into another room, Ellen broke out again, &ldquo;I want my
mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia turned white and struggled with herself for a moment, then
she spoke. That which she was doing of the nature of a crime was in
reality more foreign to her nature than virtue, and her instinct was
to return to her narrow and straight way in spite of its cramping of
love and natural longings. &ldquo;Who is your mother, darling?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;And what is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen was silent, except for that one cry, &ldquo;I want my
mother!&rdquo;  The persistency of the child, in spite of her youth
and her distress, was almost invulnerable. She came of a stiff-necked
family on one side at least, and sometimes stiff-neckedness is more
pronounced in a child than in an adult, in whom it may be tempered by
experience and policy. &ldquo;I want my mother! I want my
mother!&rdquo; Ellen repeated in her gentle wail as plaintively
inconsequent as the note of a bird, and would say no more.</p>

<p>Then Cynthia displayed the parrot, but a parrot was too fine and
fierce a bird for Ellen. She would have preferred him as a subject
for her imagination, which could not be harmed by his beak and claws,
and she liked Cynthia's story about him better than the gorgeous
actuality of the bird himself. She shrank back from that shrieking
splendor, clinging with strong talons to his cage wires, against
which he pressed cruelly his red breast and beat his gold-green
wings, and through which he thrust his hooked beak, and glared with
his yellow eyes.</p>

<p>Ellen fairly sobbed at last when the parrot thrust out a wicked
and deceiving claw towards her, and said something in his unearthly
shriek which seemed to have a distinct reference to her, and fired at
her a volley of harsh &ldquo;How do's&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Good-mornings,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good-nights,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Polly want a cracker's,&rdquo; then finished with a wild
shriek of laughter, her note of human grief making a curious chord
with the bird's of inhuman mirth. &ldquo;I want my mother!&rdquo; she
panted out, and wept, and would not be comforted. Then Cynthia took
her away from the parrot and produced the doll. Then truly did the
sentiment of emulative motherhood in her childish breast console her
for the time for her need of her own mother. Such a doll as that she
had never seen, not even in the store-windows at Christmas-time.
Still, she had very fine dolls for a little girl whose relatives were
not wealthy, but this doll was like a princess, and nearly as large
as Ellen.</p>

<p>Ellen held out her arms for this ravishing creature in a French
gown, looked into its countenance of unflinching infantile grace and
amiability and innocence, and her fickle heart betrayed her, and she
laughed with delight, and the tension of anxiety relaxed in her
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is her mother?&rdquo; she asked of Cynthia, having a
very firm belief in the little girl-motherhood of dolls. She could
not imagine a doll without her little mother, and even in the cases
of the store-dolls, she wondered how their mothers could let them be
sold, and mothered by other little girls, however poor they might be.
But she never doubted that her own dolls were her very own children
even if they had been bought in a store. So now she asked Cynthia
with an indescribably pitying innocence, &ldquo;Where is her
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia laughed and looked adoringly at the child with the doll in
her arms. &ldquo;She has no mother but you,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;She is yours, but once she belonged to a dear little boy, who
used to live with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen stared thoughtfully: she had never seen a little boy with a
doll. The lady seemed to read her thought, for she laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This little boy had curls, and he wore dresses like a
little girl, and he was just as pretty as a little girl, and he loved
to play with dolls like a little girl,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Ellen, in a small, gentle voice.
&ldquo;Don't he want her now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, darling,&rdquo; said Cynthia; &ldquo;he is not here; he
has been gone away two years, and he had left off his baby curls and
his dresses, and stopped playing with her for a year before
that.&rdquo;  Cynthia sighed and drew down her mouth, and Ellen
looked at her lovingly and wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be you his mother?&rdquo; she asked, piteously; then,
before Cynthia could answer, her own lip quivered and she sobbed out
again, even while she hugged her doll-child to her bosom, &ldquo;I
want my mother! I want my mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All that day the struggle went on. Cynthia Lennox, leading her
little guest, who always bore the doll, traversed the fine old house
in search of distraction, for the heart of the child was sore for its
mother, and success was always intermittent. The music-box played,
the pictures were explained, and even old trunks of laid-away
treasures ransacked. Cynthia took her through the hot-houses and gave
her all the flowers she liked to pick, to still that longing cry of
hers. Cynthia Lennox had fine hot-houses kept by an old colored man,
the husband of her black cook. Her establishment was very small; her
one other maid she had sent away early that morning to make a visit
with a sick sister in another town. The old colored couple had lived
in her family since she was born, and would have been silent had she
stolen a whole family of children. Ellen caught a glimpse of a bent,
dark figure at one end of the pink-house as they entered; he glanced
up at her with no appearance of surprise, only a broad, welcoming
expansion of his whole face, which caused her to shrink; then he
shuffled out in response to an order of his mistress.</p>

<p>Ellen stared at the pinks, swarming as airily as butterflies in
motley tints of palest rose to deepest carmine over the blue-green
jungle of their stems; she sniffed the warm, moist, perfumed
atmosphere; she followed Cynthia down the long perspective of bloom,
then she said again that she wanted her mother; and Cynthia led her
into the rose-house, then into one where the grapes hung low overhead
and the air was as sweet and strong as wine, but even there Ellen
wanted her mother.</p>

<p>But it was not until the next morning when she was eating her
breakfast that the climax came. Then the door-bell rang, and
presently Cynthia was summoned into another room. She kissed Ellen,
and bade her go on with her breakfast and she would return shortly;
but before she had quite left the room a man stood unexpectedly in
the door-way, a man who looked younger than Cynthia. He had a fair
mustache, a high forehead scowling over near-sighted blue eyes, and
stood with a careless slouch of shoulders in a gray coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he began. Then he stopped short when
he saw Ellen in her tall chair staring shyly around at him through
her soft golden mist of hair. &ldquo;What child is that?&rdquo; he
demanded; but Cynthia with a sharp cry sprang to him, and fairly
pulled him out of the room, and closed the door.</p>

<p>Then Ellen heard voices rising higher and higher, and Cynthia say,
in a voice of shrill passion: &ldquo;I cannot, Lyman. I cannot give
her up. You don't know what I have suffered since George married and
took little Robert away. I can't let this child go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the man's voice, hoarse with excitement: &ldquo;But,
Cynthia, you must; you are mad. Think what this means. Why, if people
know what you have done, kept this child, while all this search has
been going on, and made no effort to find out who she
was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did ask her, and she would not tell me,&rdquo; Cynthia
said, miserably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! what of that? That is nothing but a subterfuge.
You must have seen in the papers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not looked at a paper since she came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you have not. You were afraid to. Why, good God!
Cynthia Lennox, I don't know but you will stand in danger of lynching
if people ever find this out, that you have taken in this child and
kept her in this way&mdash;I don't know what people will
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen waited for no more; she rose softly, she gathered up her
great doll which sat in a little chair near by, she gathered up her
pink-and-gold cup which had been given her, and the pinks which had
been brought from the hot-house the day before, which Cynthia had
arranged in a vase beside her plate, then she stole very softly out
of the side door, and out of the house, and ran down the street as
fast as her little feet could carry her.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter V</h3>

<p>That morning, after the street in front of Lloyd's factory had
been cleared of the flocking employ&eacute;s with their little
dinner-boxes, and the great broadside of the front windows had been
set with faces of the workers, a distracted figure came past. A young
fellow at a window of the cutting-room noticed her first. &ldquo;Look
at that, Jim Tenny,&rdquo; said he, with a shove of an elbow towards
his next neighbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, will ye?&rdquo; growled Jim Tenny, but he
looked.</p>

<p>Then three girls from the stitching-room came crowding up behind
with furtively tender pressings of round arms against the shoulders
of the young men. &ldquo;We come in here to see if that was Eva
Loud,&rdquo; said one, a sharp-faced, alert girl, not pretty, but a
favorite among the male employ&eacute;s, to the constant wonder of
the other girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it's her fast enough,&rdquo; rejoined another, a
sweet-faced blonde with an exaggeratedly fashionable coiffure and a
noticeable smartness in the tie of her neck-ribbon and the set of her
cotton waist. &ldquo;Just look at the poor thing's hair. Only see how
frowsly it is, and she has come out without her hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't wonder,&rdquo; said the third girl, who was
elderly and whose complexion was tanned and weather-beaten almost to
the color of the leather upon which she worked. Yet through this
seamed and discolored face, with thin grayish hair drawn back tightly
from the temples, one could discern, as through a transparent mask, a
past prettiness and an exceeding gentleness and faithfulness.
&ldquo;If my sister's little Helen was to be lost I shouldn't know
whether my hat was on or not,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I believe I
should go raving mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn't have to slave as you have done supportin' it
ever since your sister's husband died,&rdquo; said the pretty girl.
&ldquo;Only look how Eva's waist bags in the back and she 'ain't got
any belt on. I wouldn't come out lookin' so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should die if I didn't have something to work for. That's
the difference between being a worker and a slave,&rdquo; said the
other girl, simply. &ldquo;Poor Eva!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a pretty young one,&rdquo; said the first
girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as if Eva Loud's skirt was comin' off,&rdquo;
said the pretty girl. She pressed close to Jim Tenny with a familiar
air of proprietorship as she spoke, but the young man did not seem to
heed her. He was looking over his bench at the figure on the street
below, and his heavy black eyebrows were scowling, and his mouth
set.</p>

<p>Jim Tenny was handsome after a swarthy and grimy fashion, for the
tint of the leather seemed to have become absorbed into his skin. His
black mustache bristled roughly, but his face was freer than usual
from his black beard-stubble, because the day before had been Sunday
and he had shaved. His black right hand with its squat discolored
nails grasped his cutting-knife with a hard clutch, his left held the
piece of leather firmly in place, while he stared out with that angry
and anxious scowl at Eva, who had paused on the street below, and was
staring up at the windows, as if she meditated a wild search in the
factory for the lost child. There was a curious likeness between the
two faces; people had been accustomed to say that Eva Loud and her
gentleman looked more like brother and sister than a courting couple,
and there was, moreover, a curious spirit of comradeship between the
two. It asserted itself now with the young man, in opposition to the
more purely sexual attraction of the pretty girl who was leaning
against him, and for whom he had deserted Eva.</p>

<p>After all, friendship and good comradeship are a steadier force
than love, if not as overwhelming, and it may be that tortoise of the
emotions which outruns the hare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, for my part, I think a good deal more of Eva Loud
than if she had come out all frizzed and ruffled&mdash;shows her
heart is in the right place,&rdquo; said the man who had spoken
first. He spoke with a guttural drawl, and kept on with his work, but
there was a meaning in his words for the pretty girl, who had
coquetted with him before taking up with Jim Tenny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said another man at Jim Tenny's right.
&ldquo;She is right to come out as she has done when she is so
anxious for the child.&rdquo;  This man was a fair-haired Swede, and
he spoke English with a curious and careful precision, very different
from the hurried, slurring intonations of the other men. He had been
taught the language by a philanthropic young lady, a college
graduate, in whose father's family he had lived when he first came to
America, and in consequence he spoke like a gentleman and had some
considerable difficulty in understanding his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva Loud has had a damned hard time, take it all
together,&rdquo; spoke out another man, looking over is bench at the
girl on the street. He was small and thin and wiry, a mass of
brown-coated muscles under his loose-hanging gingham shirt. He plied
feverishly his cutting-knife with his lean, hairy hands as he spoke.
He was accounted one of the best and swiftest cutters in Lloyd's, and
he worked unceasingly, for he had an invalid wife and four children
to support. Now and then he had to stop to cough, then he worked
faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said the first man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is so,&rdquo; said the Swede, with a nod of his
fair head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now to lose this young one that she set her life
by,&rdquo; said the first girl, with an evident point of malice in
her tone, and a covert look at the pretty girl at Jim Tenny's side.
Jim Tenny paled under his grime; the hand which held the knife
clinched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you s'pose has become of the young one?&rdquo; said
the first girl. &ldquo;There's a good many out from the shop huntin'
this mornin', ain't there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty,&rdquo; said the first man, laconically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You three were out all day yesterday, wa'n't
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jim and Carl and me were out till after
midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wonder whether the poor little young one is alive?
Don't seem as if she could be&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there! look there!&rdquo; screamed the elderly girl
suddenly. &ldquo;Look at <em>there!</em>&rdquo;  She began to dance,
she laughed, she sobbed, she waved her lean hands frantically out of
the window, leaning far over the bench. &ldquo;Look at there!&rdquo;
she kept crying. Then she turned and ran out of the room, with the
other girls and half the cutting-room after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it, she's got the child!&rdquo; said the thin man. He
kept on working, his dark, sinewy hands flying over the sheets of
leather, but the tears ran down his cheeks. Lloyd's emptied itself
into the street, and surrounded Eva Loud and Ellen, who, running
aimlessly, had come straight to her aunt. Jim Tenny was first.</p>

<p>Eva stood clasping the child, who was too frightened to cry, and
was breathing in hushed gasps, her face hidden on her aunt's broad
bosom. Eva had caught her up at the first sight of her, and now she
stood clasping her fiercely, and looking at them all as if she
thought they wanted to rob her of the child. Even when a great cheer
went up from the crowd, and was echoed by another from the factory,
with an accompaniment of waving bare, leather-stained arms and hands,
that expression of desperate defiance instead of the joy of recovery
did not leave her face, not until she saw Jim Tenny's face working
with repressed emotion and met his eyes full of the memory of old
comradeship. Then her bold heart and her pride all melted and she
burst out in a great wail before them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim!&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;Oh, Jim, I lost you,
and then I thought I'd lost her! Oh, Jim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a chorus of feminine sobs, for Eva's wild weeping
had precipitated the ready sympathy of half the girls present. The
men started a cheer to cover a certain chivalrous shamefacedness
which was upon them at the sight of the girl's grief, and another
cheer from the factory echoed it. Then came another sound, the great
steam-whistle of Lloyd's; then the whistles of the other neighboring
factories responded, and people began to swarm out of them, and the
windows to fill with eager faces. Jim Tenny grasped Eva's arm with a
grasp like a vise. &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; said he, sharply.
&ldquo;Come this way, Eva.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim! oh, Jim!&rdquo; Eva sobbed again; but she followed
him, little Ellen's golden fleece tossing over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's got her; she's got her!&rdquo; shouted the
people.</p>

<div align="center">
<a href="images/plimage3.jpg">
<img src="images/plimage3.jpg" width="445" height="642"
alt="'She's got her!' Shouted the people"></a>
</div>

<p>Then the leather-stained hands gyrated, the cheers went up, and
again the whistles blew.</p>

<p>Jim Tenny, with his hand on Eva's arm, pushed his way through the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you goin', Jim?&rdquo; asked the pretty girl at his
elbow, but he pushed past her roughly, and did not seem to hear.
Eva's face was all inflamed and convulsed with sobs, but she did not
dream of covering it&mdash;she was full of the holy shamelessness of
grief and joy. &ldquo;Let me see her! let me see her! Oh, the dear
little thing, only look at her! Where have you been, precious? Are
you hungry? Oh, Nellie, she is hungry, I know! She looks thin. Run
over to the bakery and buy her some cookies, quick! Are you cold?
Give her this sacque. Only look at her! Kate, only look at her! Are
you hurt, darling? Has anybody hurt you? If anybody has, he shall be
hung! Oh, you darling! Only see her, 'Liza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jim Tenny, his mouth set, his black brows scowling, his hard
grasp on Eva's arm, pushed straight through the gathering crowd until
they came to Clarkson's stables at the rear of Lloyd's, where he kept
his horse and buggy&mdash;for he lived at a distance from his work,
and drove over every morning. He pointed to a chair which a hostler
had occupied, tilted against the wall, for a morning smoke, after the
horses were fed and watered, and which he had vacated to join the
jubilant crowd. &ldquo;Sit down there,&rdquo; he said to Eva. Then he
hailed a staring man coming out of the office. &ldquo;Here, help me
in with my horse, quick!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>The man stared still, with slowly rising indignation. He was
portly and middle-aged, the senior partner of the firm, who seldom
touched his own horses of late years, and had a son at Harvard.
&ldquo;What's to pay? What do you mean? Anybody sick?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me into the buggy with my horse!&rdquo; shouted Jim
Tenny. &ldquo;I tell you the child is found, and I've got to take it
home to its folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't they know yet? Is that it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I tell you.&rdquo;  Jim was backing out his horse as
he spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarkson seized a harness and threw the collar over the
horse's head, while Jim ran out the buggy. When Mr. Clarkson lifted
Eva and Ellen into the buggy he gave the child's head a pat.
&ldquo;God bless it!&rdquo; he said, and his voice broke.</p>

<p>The horse was restive. Jim took a leap into the buggy at Eva's
side, and they were out with a dash and a swift rattle. The crowd
parted before them, and cheer after cheer went up. The whistles
sounded again. Then all the city bells rang out. They were signalling
the other searchers that the child was found. Jim and Eva and Ellen
made a progress of triumph down the street. The crowd pursued them
with cheers of rejoicing; doors and windows flew open; the
house-yards were full of people. Jim drove as fast as he could,
scowling hard to hide his tenderness and pity. Eva sat by his side,
weeping in her terrible candor of grief and joy, and Ellen's golden
locks tossed on her shoulder.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter VI</h3>

<p>As Jim Tenny, with Eva Loud and the child, drove down the road
towards the Brewster house, his horse and buggy became the nucleus of
a gathering procession, shouting and exclaiming, with voices all
tuned to one key of passionate sympathy. There were even many women
of the poorer class who had no sense of indecency in following the
utmost lead of their tender emotions. Some of them bore children of
their own in their arms, and were telling them with passionate
croonings to look at the other little girl in the carriage who had
been lost, and gone away a whole day and two nights from her mother.
They often called out fondly to Ellen and Eva, and ordered Jim to
wait a moment that they might look at the poor darling. But Jim drove
on as fast as he was able, though he had sometimes to rein his horse
sharply to avoid riding down some lean racing boys, who would now and
then shoot ahead of him with loud whoops of triumph. Once as he drove
he laid one hand caressingly over Eva's. &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; he
said, hoarsely and shamefacedly, and Eva sobbed loudly. When Jim
reached Mrs. Zelotes Brewster's house there was a swift displacement
of lights and shadows in a window, a door flew open, and the gaunt
old woman was at the wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Stop! Bring her in here to
me! Let me have her! Give her to me; I have got everything ready!
Come, Ellen&mdash;come to grandmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a mad rush from the opposite direction, and the
child's mother was there, reaching into the buggy with fierce arms of
love and longing. &ldquo;Give her to me!&rdquo; she shrieked out.
&ldquo;Give me my baby, Eva Loud! Oh, Ellen, where have you
been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny Brewster dragged her child from her sister's arms so
forcibly that she seemed fairly to fly over the wheel. Then she
strained her to her hungry bosom, covering her with kisses, wetting
her soft face and yellow hair with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My baby, mother's darling, mother's baby!&rdquo; she gasped
out with great pants of satisfied love; but another pair of lean,
wiry old arms stole around the child's slender body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her to me!&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Zelotes Brewster.
&ldquo;She is my son's child, and I have a right to her! You will
kill her, goin' on so over her. Give her to me! I have everything all
ready in my house to take care of her. Give her to me, Fanny
Loud!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your hands off her!&rdquo; cried Fanny. &ldquo;She's
my own baby, and nobody's goin' to take her away from me, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her to me this minute!&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes
Brewster. &ldquo;You'll kill her, goin' on so. You're frightenin' her
to death. Give her to me this minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen, meanwhile, that little tender blossom tossed helplessly by
contending waves of love, was weeping and trembling with joy at the
feel of her mother's arms and with awe and terror at this tempest of
passion which she had evoked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her to me!&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Zelotes Brewster.</p>

<p>The crowd who had followed stood gaping with working faces. The
mothers wept over their own children. Eva stood at her sister's
elbow, with a hand on one of the child's, which was laid over Fanny's
shoulder. Jim Tenny had his face hidden on his horse's neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her to me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes again. &ldquo;Give
her to me, I say! I am her own grandmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am her own mother!&rdquo; called out Fanny, with a
great master-note of love and triumph and defiance. &ldquo;I'm her
own mother, and I've got her, and nobody but God shall take her from
me again.&rdquo;  The tears streamed down her cheeks; she kissed the
child with pale, parted lips. She was at once pathetic and terrible.
She was human love and selfishness incarnate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes Brewster stared at her, and her face changed suddenly
and softened. She turned and went back into her own house. Her gray
head appeared a second beside her window, then sank out of sight. She
was kneeling there with her Bible at her side, a sudden sweet
humility of thankfulness rising from her whole spirit like a perfume,
when Fanny, with Eva following, still clinging to the child's little
hand over her sister's shoulder, went across the yard to her own
house to tell her husband. The others followed, and stood about
outside, listening with curiosity sanctified by intensest sympathy.
One nervous-faced boy leaped on the slant of the bulkhead to peer in
a window of the sitting-room, and when his mother pulled him back
forcibly, rubbed his grimy little knuckles across his eyes, and a
dark smooch appeared on his nose and cheeks. He was a young boy, very
small and thin for his age. He whispered to his mother and she
nodded, and he darted off in the direction of his own home.</p>

<p>Andrew Brewster had just come home after an all-night's search,
and he was in his bedroom in the bitter sleep of utter exhaustion and
despair. Suddenly his heart had failed him and his brain had reeled.
He had begun to feel dazed, to forget for a minute what he was
looking for. He had made incoherent replies to the men with him, and
finally one, after a whispered consultation with the others, had
said: &ldquo;Look at here, Andrew, old fellow; you'd better go home
and rest a bit. We'll look all the harder while you're gone, and
maybe she'll be found when you wake up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will be found?&rdquo; Andrew asked, with a dazed look.
He reeled as if he were drunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't had anything, has he?&rdquo; one of the men
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a drop to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew's lips trembled perceptibly; his forehead was knitted with
vacuous perplexity; his eyes reflected blanks of unreason; his whole
body had an effect of weak settling and subsidence. The man who
worked next to him in the cutting-room at Lloyd's, and had searched
at his side indefatigably from the first, stole a tender hand under
his shoulder. &ldquo;Come along with me, old man,&rdquo; he said, and
Andrew obeyed.</p>

<p>When Fanny and Eva came in with the child, he lay prostrate on the
bed, and scarcely seemed to breathe. A great qualm of fear shot over
Fanny for a second. His father had died of heart-disease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;dead?&rdquo; she gasped to Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course he ain't,&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;He's
asleep; he's wore out. Andrew, Andrew, Andrew, wake up! She's found,
Andrew; Ellen's found.&rdquo;  But Andrew did not stir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is!&rdquo; gasped Fanny, again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he ain't. Andrew, Andrew Brewster, wake up, wake up!
Ellen's here! She's found!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny put Ellen down, and bent over Andrew and listened.
&ldquo;No, I can hear him breathe,&rdquo; she cried. Then she kissed
him, and leaned her mouth close to his ear. &ldquo;Andrew!&rdquo; she
said, in a voice which Eva and Ellen had never heard before.
&ldquo;Andrew, poor old man, wake up; she's found! Our child is
found!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Andrew still did not wake, but only stirred, and moaned
faintly, Fanny lifted Ellen onto the bed. &ldquo;Kiss poor father,
and wake him,&rdquo; she told her.</p>

<p>Ellen, whose blue eyes were big with fright and wonder, whose lips
were quivering, and whose little body was vibrating with the strain
of her nerves, laid her soft cheek against her father's rough, pale
one, and stole a little arm under his neck. &ldquo;Father, wake
up!&rdquo; she called out in her little, trembling, sweet voice, and
that reached Andrew Brewster in the depths of his own physical
inertness. He opened his eyes and looked at the child, and the light
came into them, and then the sound of his sobbing filled the house
and reached the people out in the yard, and an echo arose from them.
Gradually the crowd dispersed. Jim Tenny, before he drove away, went
to the door and spoke to Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do?&rdquo; he asked, with a curious, tender
roughness. He did not look at her as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; thank you, Jim,&rdquo; replied Eva.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young man reached out a hand and stroked her rough
hair. &ldquo;Well, take care of yourself, old girl,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Eva went to her sister as Jim went out of the yard. Ellen was in
the sitting-room with her father, and Fanny had gone to the kitchen
to heat some milk for the child, whom she firmly believed to have had
nothing to eat during her absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I can't stop; I must get
some milk for her; she must be 'most starved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny turned and looked at Eva, who cast down her eyes before her
in a very shamefacedness of happiness and contrition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo; repeated Fanny, staring at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got Jim back, I guess, as well as Ellen,&rdquo; said
Eva, &ldquo;and I'm going to be a good woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all the crowd of people outside had gone, the little nervous
boy raced into the Brewster yard with a tin cup of chestnuts in his
hand. He knocked at the side door, and when Fanny opened it he thrust
them upon her. &ldquo;They're for her!&rdquo; he blurted out, and was
gone, racing like a deer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you want the cup back?&rdquo; Fanny shouted after
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; he called back, and that, although his
mother had charged him to bring back the cup or he would get a
scolding.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter VII</h3>

<p>Ellen had clung fast all the time to her doll, her bunch of pinks,
and her cup and saucer; or, rather, she had guarded them jealously.
&ldquo;Where did you get all these things?&rdquo; her aunt Eva had
asked her, amazedly, when she first caught sight of her, and then had
not waited for an answer in her wild excitement of joy at the
recovery of the child. The great, smiling wax doll had ridden between
Jim and Eva in the buggy, Eva had held the pink cup and saucer with a
kind of mechanical carefulness, and Ellen herself clutched the pinks
in one little hand, though she crushed them against her aunt's bosom
as she sat in her lap. Ellen's grandmother and aunt had glanced at
these treasures with momentary astonishment, and so had her mother,
but curiosity was in abeyance for both of them for the time; rapture
at the sight of the beloved child at whose loss they had suffered
such agonies was the one emotion of their souls. But later
investigation was to follow.</p>

<p>When Ellen did not seem to care for her hot milk liberally
sweetened in her own mug, and griddle-cakes with plenty of syrup, her
mother looked at her, and her eyes of love sharpened with inquiry.
&ldquo;Ain't you hungry?&rdquo; she said. Ellen shook her head. She
was sitting at the table in the dining-room, and her father, mother,
and aunt were all hovering about her, watching her. Some of the
neighbor women were also in the room, staring with a sort of
deprecating tenderness of curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel sick?&rdquo; Ellen's father inquired,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't feel sick, do you?&rdquo; repeated her
mother.</p>

<p>Ellen shook her head.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Zelotes Brewster came in with her
black-and-white-checked shawl pinned around her gaunt old face, which
had in it a strange softness and sweetness, which made Fanny look at
her again, after the first glance, and not know why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've got our blessing back again, mother,&rdquo; said her
son Andrew, in a broken voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she won't eat her breakfast, now mother has gone and
cooked it for her, so nice, too,&rdquo; said Fanny, in a tone of
confidence which she had never before used towards Mrs. Zelotes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't feel sick, do you, Ellen?&rdquo; asked her
grandmother.</p>

<p>Ellen shook her head. &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says she don't feel sick, and she ain't hungry,&rdquo;
Andrew said, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if she would eat one of my new doughnuts. I've got
some real nice ones,&rdquo; said a neighbor&mdash;the stout woman
from the next house, whose breadth of body seemed to symbolize a
corresponding spiritual breadth of motherliness, as she stood there
looking at the child who had been lost and was found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you want one of Aunty Wetherhed's nice
doughnuts?&rdquo; asked Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I thank you,&rdquo; replied Ellen. Eva started suddenly
with an air of mysterious purpose, opened a door, ran down cellar,
and returned with a tumbler of jelly, but Ellen shook her head even
at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had your breakfast?&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>Then Ellen was utterly quiet. She did not speak; she made no sign
or motion. She sat still, looking straight before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you hear, Ellen?&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;Have you
had your breakfast this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Auntie Eva if you have had your breakfast,&rdquo; Eva
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes Brewster spoke with more authority, and she went
further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell grandmother if you have had your breakfast, and where
you had it,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>But Ellen was dumb and motionless. They all looked at one another.
&ldquo;Tell Aunty Wetherhed: that's a good girl,&rdquo; said the
stout woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are those things she had when I first saw her?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Zelotes, suddenly. Eva went into the sitting-room, and
fetched them out&mdash;the bunch of pinks, the cup and saucer, and
the doll. Ellen's eyes gave a quick look of love and delight at the
doll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had these, luggin' along in her little arms, when I
first caught sight of her comin',&rdquo; said Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get them, Ellen?&rdquo; asked Fanny.
&ldquo;Who gave them to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen was silent, with all their inquiring eyes fixed upon her
face like a compelling battery. &ldquo;Where have you been, Ellen,
all the time you have been gone?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Zelotes.
&ldquo;Now you have got back safe, you must tell us where you have
been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew stooped his head down to the child's, and rubbed his rough
cheek against her soft one, with his old facetious caress.
&ldquo;Tell father where you've been,&rdquo; he whispered. Ellen gave
him a little piteous glance, and her lip quivered, but she did not
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you s'pose she got them?&rdquo; whispered one
neighbor to another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't imagine; that's a beautiful doll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't it? It must have cost a lot. I know, because my
Hattie had one her aunt gave her last Christmas; that one cost a
dollar and ninety-eight cents, and it didn't begin to compare with
this. That's a handsome cup and saucer, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you can get real handsome cups and saucers to
Crosby's for twenty-five cents. I don't think so much of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them pinks must have come from a greenhouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there's lots of greenhouses in the city besides the
florists. That don't help much.&rdquo;  Then the first woman inclined
her lips closely to the other woman's ear and whispered, causing the
other to start back. &ldquo;No, I can't believe she would,&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came from those Louds on her mother's side,&rdquo;
whispered the first woman, guardedly, with dark emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; said Fanny, suddenly, and almost sharply,
&ldquo;you didn't take those things in any way you hadn't ought to,
did you? Tell mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo; cried Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she did, it's the first time a Brewster ever
stole,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes. Her face was no longer strange with
unwonted sweetness as she looked at Fanny.</p>

<p>Andrew put his face down to Ellen's again. &ldquo;Father knows she
didn't steal the things; never mind,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stout woman made a soft, ponderous rush out of the
room and the house. She passed the window with oscillating
swiftness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's Miss Wetherhed gone?&rdquo; said one woman to
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's thought of somethin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she left her bread in the oven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she's thought of somethin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very old lady, who had been sitting in a rocking-chair on the
other side of the room, rose trembling and came to Ellen and leaned
over her, looking at her with small, black, bright eyes through
gold-rimmed spectacles. The old woman was deaf, and her voice was
shrill and high-pitched to reach her own consciousness. &ldquo;What
did such a good little girl as you be run away from father and mother
for?&rdquo; she piped, going back to first principles and the root of
the whole matter, since she had heard nothing of the discussion which
had been going on about her, and had supposed it to deal with
them.</p>

<p>Ellen gasped. Suddenly all her first woe returned upon her
recollection. She turned innocent, accusing eyes upon her father's
loving face, then her mother's and aunt's. &ldquo;You said&mdash;you
said&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered out, but then her father
and mother were both down upon their knees before her in her chair
embracing her, and Eva, too, seized her little hands. &ldquo;You
mustn't ever think of what you heard father and mother say,
Ellen,&rdquo; Andrew said, solemnly. &ldquo;You must forget all about
it. Father and mother were both very wrong and
wicked&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Aunt Eva, too,&rdquo; sobbed Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they didn't mean what they said,&rdquo; continued
Andrew. &ldquo;You are the greatest blessing in this whole world to
father and mother; you're all they have got. You don't know what
father and mother have been through, thinking you were lost and they
might never see their little girl again. Now you mustn't ever think
of what they said again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you won't ever hear them say it again, Ellen,&rdquo;
Fanny Brewster said, with a noble humbling of herself before her
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you won't,&rdquo; said Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother is goin' to try to do better, and have more
patience, and not let you hear such talk any more,&rdquo; said Fanny,
kissing Ellen passionately, and rising with Andrew's arm around
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going to try, too, Ellen,&rdquo; said Eva.</p>

<p>The stout woman came padding softly and heavily into the room, and
there was a bright-blue silken gleam in her hand. She waved a whole
yard of silk of the most brilliant blue before Ellen's dazzled eyes.
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said she, triumphantly, &ldquo;if you will tell
Aunty Wetherhed where you've been, and all about it, she'll give you
all this beautiful silk to make a new dress for your new
dolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked in the woman's face, she looked at the blue silk, and
she looked at the doll, but she was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only think what a beautiful dress it will make!&rdquo; said
a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And see how pretty it goes with the dolly's light
hair,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; whispered Andrew, &ldquo;you tell father, and
he'll buy you a whole pound of candy down to the store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't wonder if I could find something to make your
dolly a cloak,&rdquo; said a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I'll make her a beautiful little bonnet, if you'll
tell,&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only think, a whole pound of candy!&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll buy you a gold ring,&rdquo; Eva cried
out&mdash;&ldquo;a gold ring with a little blue stone in
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you shall go to ride with mother on the cars
to-morrow,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father will get you some oranges, too,&rdquo; said
Andrew.</p>

<p>But Ellen sat silent and unmoved by all that sweet bribery, a
little martyr to something within herself; a sense of honor, love for
the lady who had concealed her, and upon whom her confession might
bring some dire penalty; or perhaps she was strengthened in her
silence by something less worthy&mdash;possibly that stiff-neckedness
which had descended to her from a long line of Puritans upon her
father's side. At all events she was silent, and opposed successfully
her one little new will to the onslaught of all those older and more
experienced ones before her, though nobody knew at what cost of agony
to herself. She had always been a singularly docile and obedient
child; this was the first persistent disobedience of her whole life,
and it reacted upon herself with a cruel spiritual hurt. She sat
clasping the great doll, the pinks, and the pink cup and saucer
before her on the table&mdash;a lone little weak child, opposing her
single individuality against so many, and to her own hurt and horror
and self-condemnation, and she did not weaken; but all at once her
head drooped on one side, and her father caught her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! you can all stop tormentin' this blessed
child!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Ellen, Ellen, look at Father! Oh,
mother, look here; she's fainted dead away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Ellen came to herself she was on the bed in her mother's
room, and her aunt Eva was putting some of her beautiful cologne on
her head, and her mother was trying to make her drink water, and her
grandmother had a glass of her currant wine, and they were calling to
her with voices of far-off love, as if from another world.</p>

<p>And after that she was questioned no more about her mysterious
journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherever she has been, she has got no harm,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Zelotes Brewster, &ldquo;and there's no use in trying to drive a
child, when it comes of our family. She's got some notion in her
head, and you've got to leave her alone to get over it. She's got
back safe and sound, and that's the main thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew where she got those things,&rdquo; Fanny
said. Looseness of principle as to property rights was not as strange
to her imagination as to that of her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>For a long time afterwards she passed consciously and uneasily by
cups and saucers in stores, and would not look their way lest she
should see the counterpart of Ellen's, which was S&egrave;vres, and
worth more than the whole counterful, had she only known it, and she
hurried past the florists who displayed pinks in their windows. The
doll was evidently not new, and she had not the same anxiety with
regard to that.</p>

<p>No one was allowed to ask Ellen further questions that day, not
even the reporters, who went away quite baffled by this infantile
pertinacity in silence, and were forced to draw upon their
imaginations, with results varying from realistic horrors to Alice in
Wonderland. Ellen was kissed and cuddled by some women and young
girls, but not many were allowed to see her. The doctor had been
called in after her fainting-fit, and pronounced it as his opinion
that she was a very nervous child, and had been under a severe
strain, and he would not answer for the result if she were to be
further excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her have her own way: if she wants to talk, let her,
and if she wants to be silent, let her alone. She is as delicate as
that cup,&rdquo; said the doctor, looking at the shell-like thing
which Ellen had brought home, with some curiosity.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>That evening Lyman Risley came to see Cynthia. He looked at her
anxiously and scrutinizingly when he entered the room, and did not
respond to her salutation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have seen the child,&rdquo; he said, in a hushed
voice, with a look towards the door as he seated himself before the
fire and spread out his hands towards the blaze. He looked nervous
and chilly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did she look?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why in the name of common-sense, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said,
abruptly, without noticing her query, &ldquo;if you had to give that
child china for a souvenir, didn't you give her something besides
Royal S&egrave;vres?&rdquo;  Lyman Risley undoubtedly looked younger
than Cynthia, but his manner even more than his looks gave him the
appearance of comparative youth. There was in it a vehemence and
impetuosity almost like that of a boy. Cynthia, with her strained
nervous intensity, seemed very much older.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? Well, it is fortunate for you that those people
have a knowledge for the most part of the fundamental properties of
the drama of life, such as bread-and-butter, and a table from which
to eat it, and a knife with which to cut it, and a bed in which to
sleep, and a stove and coal, and so on, and so on, and that the
artistic accessories, such as Royal S&egrave;vres, which is no better
than common crockery for the honest purpose of holding the tea for
the solace of the thirsty mouth of labor, is beneath their
attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does the child look, Lyman?&rdquo; asked Cynthia
Lennox. She was leaning back in a great crimson-covered chair before
the fire, a long, slender, graceful shape, in a clinging white silk
gown which was a favorite of hers for house wear. The light in the
room was subdued, coming mostly through crimson shades, and the
faint, worn lines on Cynthia's face did not show; it looked, with her
soft crown of gray hair, like a cameo against the crimson background
of the chair. The man beside her looked at her with that impatience
of his masculine estate and his superior youth, and yet with the
adoration which nothing could conquer. He had passed two-thirds of
his life, metaphorically, at this woman's feet, and had formed a
habit of admiration and lovership which no facts nor developments
could ever alter. He was frowning, he replied with a certain
sharpness, and yet he leaned towards her as he spoke, and his eyes
followed her long, graceful lines and noted the clear delicacy of her
features against the crimson background. &ldquo;How the child
looked&mdash;how the child looked; Cynthia, you do not realize what
you did. You have not the faintest realization of what it means for a
woman to keep a lost child hidden away as you did, when its parents
and half the city were hunting for it. I tell you I did not know what
the consequences might be to you if it were found out. There is wild
blood in a city like this, and even the staid old New England stream
is capable of erratic currents. I tell you I have had a day of
dreadful anxiety, and it was worse because I had to be guarded. I
dared scarcely speak to any one about the matter. I have listened on
street corners; I have made errands to newspaper offices. I meant to
get you away if&mdash; Well, never mind&mdash;I tell you, you do not
realize what you did, Cynthia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia glanced at him without moving her head, then she looked
away, her face quivering slightly, more as if from a reflection of
his agitation than from her own. &ldquo;You say you saw her,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; the man went on, &ldquo;I got fairly
desperate. I resolved to go to the fountain-head for information, and
take my chances. So down I went to Maple Street, where the Brewsters
live, and I rang the front-door bell, and the child's aunt, a
handsome, breathless kind of creature, came and ushered me into the
best parlor, and went into the next room&mdash;the
sitting-room&mdash;to call the others. I caught sight of enough women
for a woman's club in the sitting-room. Then Andrew Brewster came in,
and I offered my legal services out of friendly interest in the case,
and in that way I found out what I wanted to. Cynthia, that child has
not told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia raised herself and sat straight, and her face flashed like
a white flame. &ldquo;Were they harsh to her?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Were they cruel? Did they question her, and were they harsh
and cruel because she would not tell? Why did you not tell them
yourself? Why did you not, Lyman Risley? Why did you not tell the
whole story rather than have that child blamed? Well, I will go
myself. I will go this minute. They shall not blame that darling.
What do you think I care for myself? Let them lynch me if they want
to. I will go this minute!&rdquo;  Cynthia sprang to her feet, but
Risley, with a hoarse shout under his breath, caught hold of her and
forced her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God's sake, sit down, Cynthia!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Didn't you hear the door-bell? Somebody is coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door-bell had in fact rung, and Cynthia had not noticed it.
She lay back in her chair as the door opened, and Mrs. Norman Lloyd
entered. &ldquo;Good-evening, Cynthia,&rdquo; she said, beamingly.
&ldquo;I thought I would stop a few minutes on my way to meeting. I'm
rather early. No, don't get up,&rdquo; as Cynthia rose. &ldquo;Don't
get up; I can only stay a minute. Never mind about giving me a chair,
Mr. Risley&mdash;thank you. Yes, this is a real comfortable
chair.&rdquo;  Mrs. Lloyd, seated where the firelight played over her
wide sweep of rich skirts, and her velvet fur-trimmed cloak and
plumed bonnet, beamed upon them with an expansive benevolence and
kindliness. She was a large, handsome, florid woman. Her
grayish-brown hair was carefully crimped, and looped back from her
fat, pink cheeks, a fine shell-and-gold comb surmounted her smooth
French twist, and held her bonnet in place. She unfastened her cloak,
and a diamond brooch at her throat caught the light and blazed red
like a ruby. She was the wife of Norman Lloyd, the largest
shoe-manufacturer in the place. There was between her and Cynthia a
sort of relationship by marriage. Norman Lloyd's brother George had
married Cynthia's sister, who had died ten years before, and of whose
little son, Robert, Cynthia had had the charge. Now George, who was a
lawyer in St. Louis, had married again. Mrs. Norman had sympathized
openly with Cynthia when the child was taken from Cynthia at his
father's second marriage. &ldquo;I call it a shame,&rdquo; she had
said, &ldquo;giving that child to a perfect stranger to bring up, and
I don't see any need of George's marrying again, anyway. I don't know
what I should do if I thought Norman would marry again if I died. I
think one husband and one wife is enough for any man or woman if they
believe in the resurrection. It has always seemed to me that the
answer to that awful question in the New Testament, as to whose wife
that woman who had so many husbands would be in the other world,
meant that people who had done so much marrying on earth would have
to be old maids and old bachelors in heaven. George ought to be
ashamed of himself, and Cynthia ought to keep that child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ever since she had been very solicitously friendly towards
Cynthia, who had always imperceptibly held herself aloof from her,
owing to a difference in degree. Cynthia had no prejudices of mind,
but many of nerves, and this woman was distinctly not of her sort,
though she had a certain liking for her. Every time she was brought
in contact with her she had a painful sense of a grating adjustment
as of points of meeting which did not dovetail as they should. Norman
Lloyd represented one of the old families of the city, distinguished
by large possessions and college training, and he was the first of
his race to engage in trade. His wife came from a vastly different
stock, being the daughter of a shoe-manufacturer herself, and the
granddaughter of a cobbler who had tapped his neighbor's shoes in his
little shop in the L of his humble cottage house. Mrs. Norman Lloyd
was innocently unconscious of any reason for concealing the fact, and
was fond, when driving out to take the air in her fine carriage, of
pointing out to any stranger who happened to be with her the house
where her grandfather cobbled shoes and laid the foundation of the
family fortune. &ldquo;That all came from that little shop of my
grandfather,&rdquo; she would say, pointing proudly at Lloyd's great
factory, which was not far from the old cottage. &ldquo;Mr. Lloyd
didn't have much of anything when I married him, but I had
considerable, and Mr. Lloyd went into the factory, and he has been
blessed, and the property has increased until it has come to
this.&rdquo;  Mrs. Lloyd's chief pride was in the very facts which
others deprecated. When she considered the many-windowed pile of
Lloyd's, and that her husband was the recognized head and authority
over all those throngs of grimy men, walking with the stoop of daily
labor, carrying their little dinner-boxes with mechanical clutches of
leather-tanned fingers, she used to send up a prayer for humility,
lest evil and downfall of pride come to her. She was a pious woman, a
member of the First Baptist Church, and active in charitable work.
Mrs. Norman Lloyd adored her husband, and her estimate of him was
almost ludicrously different from that of the grimy men who flocked
to his factory, she seeing a most kindly spirited and amiable man,
devoting himself to the best interests of his employ&eacute;s, and
striving ever for their benefit rather than his own, and the others
seeing an aristocrat by birth and training, who was in trade because
of shrewd business instincts and a longing for wealth and power, but
who despised, and felt himself wholly superior to, the means by which
it was acquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain't anything but the rounds of the ladder for Norman
Lloyd to climb by, and he only sees and feels us with the soles of
his patent-leathers,&rdquo; one of the turbulent spirits in his
factory said. Mrs. Norman Lloyd would not have believed her ears had
she heard him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd had not sat long before Cynthia's fire that evening
before she opened on the subject of the lost child. &ldquo;Oh,
Cynthia, have you heard&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but Risley cut her
short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About that little girl who ran away?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Yes, we have; we were just talking about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear anything like it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd.
&ldquo;They say they can't find out where she's been. She won't tell.
Don't you believe somebody has threatened her if she does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia raised herself and began to speak, but a slight, almost
imperceptible gesture from the man beside her stopped her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say, Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no accounting for children's freaks,&rdquo; said
Risley, shortly and harshly. Mrs. Lloyd was not thin-skinned; such a
current of exuberant cordiality emanated from her own nature that she
was not very susceptible to any counter-force. Now, however, she felt
vaguely and wonderingly, as a child might have done, that for some
reason Lyman Risley was rude to her, and she had a sense of
bewildered injury. Mrs. Lloyd was always, moreover, somewhat anxious
as to the relations between Cynthia and Lyman Risley. She heard a
deal of talk about it first and last; and while she had no word of
unkind comment herself, yet she felt at times uneasy. &ldquo;Folks do
talk about Cynthia and Lyman Risley keeping company so long,&rdquo;
she told her husband; &ldquo;it's as much as twenty years. It does
seem as if they ought to get married, don't you think so, Norman? Do
you suppose it is because the property was left that way&mdash;for
you know Lyman hasn't got anything besides what he earns&mdash;or do
you suppose it is because Cynthia doesn't want to marry him? I guess
it is that. Cynthia never seemed to me as if she would ever care
enough about any man to marry him. I guess that's it; but I do think
she ought to stop his coming there quite so much, especially when
people know that about her property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia's property was hers on condition that her husband took her
name if she married, otherwise it was forfeited to her sister's
child. &ldquo;Catch a Risley ever taking his wife's name!&rdquo; said
Mrs. Lloyd. &ldquo;Of course Cynthia would be willing to give up the
money if she loved him, but I don't believe she does. It seems as if
Lyman Risley ought to see it would be better for him not to go there
so much if they weren't going to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it happened when Risley caught up her question to Cynthia in
that peremptory fashion, Mrs. Lloyd felt in addition to the present
cause some which had gone before for her grievance. She addressed
herself thereafter entirely and pointedly to Cynthia. &ldquo;Did you
ever see that little girl, Cynthia?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cynthia, in a voice so strange that the
other woman stared wonderingly at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't you feeling well, Cynthia?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, thank you,&rdquo; said Cynthia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Lloyd. Cynthia
opened her mouth as if to speak, then she glanced at Risley, whose
eyes held her, and laughed instead&mdash;a strange, nervous laugh.
Happily, Mrs. Lloyd did not wait for her answer. She had her own
important information to impart. She had in reality stopped for that
purpose. &ldquo;Well, I have seen her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I met
her in front of Crosby's one day last summer. And she was so
sweet-looking I stopped and spoke to her&mdash;I couldn't help it.
She had beautiful eyes, and the softest light curls, and she was
dressed so pretty, and the flowers on her hat were nice. The
embroidery on her dress was very fine, too. Usually, you know, those
people don't care about the fineness, as long as it is wide, and
showy, and bright-colored. I asked her what her name was, and she
answered just as pretty, and her mother told me how old she was. Her
mother was a handsome woman, though she had an up-and-coming kind of
way with her. But she seemed real pleased to have me notice the
child. Where do you suppose she was all that time,
Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was in some safe place, undoubtedly,&rdquo; said
Risley, and again Mrs. Lloyd felt that she was snubbed, though not
seeing how nor why, and again she rebelled with that soft and gentle
persistency in her own course which was the only rebellion of which
she was capable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose she was, Cynthia?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think some woman must have seen her, and coaxed her in
and kept her, she was such a pretty child,&rdquo; said Cynthia,
defiantly and desperately. But the other woman looked at her in
wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cynthia, I can't believe that,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;It don't seem as if any woman could be so bad as that when the
child's mother was in such agony over her.&rdquo;  And then she
added, &ldquo;I can't believe it, because it seems to me that if any
woman was bad enough to do that, she couldn't have given her up at
all, she was such a beautiful child.&rdquo;  Mrs. Norman Lloyd had no
children of her own, and was given to gazing with eyes of gentle envy
at pretty, rosy little girls, frilled with white embroidery like
white pinks, dancing along in leading hands of maternal love.
&ldquo;It don't seem to me I could ever have given her up, if I had
once been bad enough to steal her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What put
such an idea into your head, Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the church-bell clanged out just then Lyman Risley had never
been so thankful in his life. Mrs. Lloyd rose promptly, for she had
to lead the meeting, that being the custom among the sisters in her
church. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am thankful she is
found, anyway; I couldn't have slept a wink that night if I had known
she was lost, the dear little thing. Good-night, Cynthia; don't come
to the door. Good-night, Mr. Risley. Come and see me,
Cynthia&mdash;do, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Mrs. Norman Lloyd was gone, Risley looked at Cynthia with a
long breath of relief, but she turned to him with seemingly no
appreciation of it, and repeated her declaration which Mrs. Lloyd's
coming had interrupted: &ldquo;Lyman, I am going there
to-night&mdash;this minute. Will you go with me? No, you must not go
with me. I am going!&rdquo;  She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Cynthia,&rdquo; said Risley. &ldquo;I tell you
they were not harsh to her. You don't seem to consider that they love
the child&mdash;possibly better than you can&mdash;and would not in
the nature of things be harsh to her under such circumstances. Sit
down and hear the rest of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they will be harsh by-and-by, after the first joy of
finding her is over,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;I will go and tell
them the first thing in the morning, Lyman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do nothing so foolish. They are not only not
insisting upon her telling her secret, but announced to me their
determination not to do so in the future. I wish you could have seen
that man's face when he told me what a delicate, nervous little thing
his child was, and the doctor said she must not be fretted if she had
taken a notion not to tell; and I wish you could have seen the mother
and the aunt, and the grandmother, Mrs. Zelotes Brewster. They would
all give each other and themselves up to be torn of wild beasts
first. It is easy to see where the child got her extraordinary
strength of will. They took me out in the sitting-room, and there was
a wild flurry of feminine skirts before me. I had previously
overheard myself announced as Lawyer Risley by the aunt, and the
response from various voices that they were &lsquo;goin' if he was
comin' out in the sittin'-room.&rsquo;  It always made them nervous
to see lawyers. Well, I followed the parents and the grandmother and
the aunt out. I dared not refuse when they suggested it, and I hoped
desperately that the child would not remember me from that one scared
glance she gave at me this morning. But there she sat in her little
chair, holding the doll you gave her, and she looked up at me when I
entered, and I have never in the whole course of my existence seen
such an expression upon the face of a child. Remember me? Indeed she
did, and she promised me with the faithfulest, stanchest eyes of a
woman set in a child's head that she would not tell; that I need not
fear for one minute; that the lady who had given her the doll was
quite safe. She knew, and she must have heard what I said to you this
morning. She is the most wonderful child I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia had sank back in her chair. Lyman Risley put his cigar
back between his lips; Cynthia was quite still, her delicate profile
towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you there is not the slightest danger of their
troubling the child because of her silence, and you would do an
exceedingly foolish thing, and its consequences would react not upon
yourself only, but&mdash;upon others, were you to confess the truth
to them,&rdquo; he said after a little. &ldquo;You must think of
others&mdash;of your friends, and of your sister's boy, whose loss
led you into this. This would&mdash;well, it would get into the
papers, Cynthia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that the doll continued to please her?&rdquo;
asked Cynthia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cynthia, I want you to promise,&rdquo; said her friend,
persistently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will promise, if you will promise to let me
know the minute you hear that they are treating her harshly because
of her silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Cynthia turned her face upon him. &ldquo;Lyman,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;do you think that I could do anything for
her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do anything for her?&rdquo; he repeated, vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; they cannot have money. They must be poor: the father
works in the factory. Would they allow me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed. &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you do
not realize that pride finds its native element in all strata of
society, and riches are comparative. Let me inform you that these
Brewsters, of whom this child sprung, claim as high places in the
synagogue as any of your Lennoxes and Risleys, and, what is more,
they believe themselves there. They have seen the tops of their
neighbors' heads as often as you or I. The mere fact of familiarity
with shoe-knives and leather, and hand-skill instead of brain-skill,
makes no difference with such inherent confidence of importance as
theirs. The Louds, on the other side&mdash;the handsome aunt is a
Loud&mdash;are rather below caste, but they make up for it with
defiance. And as for riches, I would have you know that the Brewsters
are as rich in their own estimation as you in yours; that they have
possessions which entirely meet their needs and their &aelig;sthetic
longings; that not only does Andrew Brewster earn exceedingly good
wages in the shop, and is able to provide plenty of nourishing food
and good clothes, but even by-and-by, if he prospers and is prudent,
something rather extra in the way of education&mdash;perhaps a piano.
I would have you know that there is a Rogers group on a little
marble-topped table in the front window, and a table in the side
window with a worked spread, on which reposes a red plush photograph
album; that there is also a set of fine parlor furniture, with
various devices in the way of silken and lace scarfs over the corners
and backs of the chairs and sofa, and that there is a tapestry
carpet; that in the sitting-room is a fine crushed-plush couch, and a
multiplicity of rocking-chairs; that there is a complete dining-set
in the next room, the door of which stood open, and even a side-board
with red napkins, and a fine display of glass, every whit as elegant
in their estimation as your cut glass in yours. The child's father
owns his house and land free of encumbrance. He told me so in the
course of his artless boasting as to what he might some day be able
to do for the precious little creature of his own flesh and blood;
and the grandmother owns her comfortable place next door, and she
herself was dressed in black silk, and I will swear the lace on her
cap was real, and she wore a great brooch containing hair of the
departed, and it was set in pearl. What are you going to do in the
face of opulence like this, Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia did not speak; her face looked as still as if it were
carved in ivory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; said the man, in a harsh voice, &ldquo;I
did not dream you were so broken up over losing that little boy of
your sister's, poor girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia still said nothing, but a tear rolled down her cheek.
Lyman Risley saw it, then he looked straight ahead, scowling over his
cigar. He seemed suddenly to realize in this woman whom he loved
something anomalous, yet lovely&mdash;a beauty, as it were, of
deformity, an over-development in one direction, though a direction
of utter grace and sweetness, like the lip of an orchid.</p>

<p>Why should she break her heart over a child whom she had never
seen before, and have no love and pity for the man who had laid his
best at her feet so long?</p>

<p>He saw at a flash the sweet yet monstrous imperfection of her, and
he loved her better for it.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter IX</h3>

<p>After Ellen's experience in running away, she dreamed her dreams
with a difference. The breath of human passion had stained the pure
crystal of her childish imagination; she peopled all her air-castles,
and sounds of wailing farewells floated from the White North of her
fancy after the procession of the evergreen trees in the west yard,
and the cherry-trees on the east had found out that they were not in
the Garden of Eden. In those days Ellen grew taller and thinner, and
the cherubic roundness of her face lengthened into a sweet
wistfulness of wonder and pleading, as of one who would look farther,
since she heard sounds and saw signs in her sky which indicated more
beyond. Andrew and Fanny watched her more anxiously than ever, and
decided not to send her to school before spring, though all the
neighbors exclaimed at their tardiness in so doing. &ldquo;She'll be
two years back of my Hattie gettin' into the high-school,&rdquo; said
one woman, bluntly, to Fanny, who retorted, angrily,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care if she's ten years behind, if she don't lose
her health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait and see if she's two years behind!&rdquo;
exclaimed Eva, who had just returned from the shop, and had entered
the room bringing a fresh breath of December air, her cheeks glowing,
her black eyes shining.</p>

<p>Eva was so handsome in those days that she fairly forced
admiration, even from those of her own sex whose delicacy of taste
she offended. She had a parcel in her hand, which she had bought at a
store on her way home, for she was getting ready to be married to Jim
Tenny. &ldquo;I tell you there don't nobody know what that young one
can do,&rdquo; continued Eva, with a radiant nod of triumph.
&ldquo;There ain't many grown-up folks round here that can read like
her, and she's studied geography, and she knows her
multiplication-table, and she can spell better than some that's been
through the high-school. You jest wait till Ellen gets started on her
schoolin'&mdash;she won't stay in the grammar-school long, I can tell
you that. She'll go ahead of some that's got a start now and think
they're 'most there.&rdquo;  Eva pulled off her hat, and the coarse
black curls on her forehead sprang up like released wire. She nodded
emphatically with a good-humored combativeness at the visiting woman
and at her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope your cheeks are red enough,&rdquo; said Fanny,
looking at her with grateful admiration.</p>

<p>The visiting woman sniffed covertly, and a retort which seemed to
her exceedingly witty was loud in her own consciousness. &ldquo;Them
that likes beets and pinies is welcome to them,&rdquo; she thought,
but she did not speak. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;folks
must do as they think best about their own children. I have always
thought a good deal of an education myself. I was brought up that
way.&rdquo;  She looked with eyes that were fairly cruel at Eva Loud
and Fanny, who had been a Loud, who had both stopped going to school
at a very early age.</p>

<p>Then the rich red flamed over Eva's forehead and neck as well as
her cheeks. There was nothing covert about her, she would drag an
ambushed enemy forth into the open field even at the risk of damaging
disclosures regarding herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you say jest what you mean, right out, Jennie
Stebbins?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You are hintin' that Fanny and
me never had no education, and twittin' us with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wa'n't our fault,&rdquo; said Fanny, no less
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it wa'n't our fault,&rdquo; assented Eva. &ldquo;We had
to quit school. Folks can live with empty heads, but they can't with
empty stomachs. It had to be one or the other. If you want to twit us
with bein' poor, you can, Jennie Stebbins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't said anything,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stebbins, with a
scared and injured air. &ldquo;I'd like to know what you're making
all this fuss about? I don't know. What did I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I'd said anything mean, I wouldn't turn tail an' run,
I'd stick to it about one minute and a half, if it killed me,&rdquo;
said Eva, scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what you was hintin' at, jest as well as we
do,&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;but it ain't so true as you and some
other folks may think, I can tell you that. If Eva and me didn't go
to school as long as some, we have always read every chance we could
get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Eva, emphatically. &ldquo;I guess
we've read enough sight more than some folks that has had a good deal
more chance to read. Fanny and me have taken books out of the library
full as much as any of the neighbors, I rather guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've read every single thing that Mrs. Southworth has ever
written,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;and that's sayin'
considerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all Pansy's and Rider Haggard's,&rdquo; declared Eva,
with triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And every one of The Duchess and Marie Corelli, and Sir
Walter Scott, and George Macdonald, and Laura Jean Libbey, and
Charles Reade, and more, besides, than I can think of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny has read 'most all Tennyson,&rdquo; said Eva, with
loyal admiration; &ldquo;she likes poetry, but I don't very well. She
has read most all Tennyson and Longfellow, and we've both read
<cite>Queechee</cite>, and <cite>St. Elmo</cite>, and <cite>Jane
Eyre</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we've read the Bible through,&rdquo; said Fanny,
&ldquo;because we read in a paper once that that was a complete
education. We made up our minds we'd read it through, and we did,
though it took us quite a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we take <cite>Zion's Herald</cite>, and <cite>The Rowe
Gazette</cite>, and <cite>The Youth's Companion</cite>,&rdquo; said
Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we've both of us learned Ellen geography and spellin'
and 'rithmetic, till we know most as much as she does,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I snum, I believe I
could get into the high-school myself, if I wasn't goin' to git
married,&rdquo; said Eva, with a gay laugh. She was so happy in those
days that her power of continued resentment was small. The tide of
her own bliss returned upon her full consciousness and overflowed,
and crested, as with glory, all petty annoyances.</p>

<p>The visiting woman took up her work, and rose to go with a
slightly abashed air, though her small brown eyes were still blanks
of impregnable defence. &ldquo;Well, I dunno what I've said to stir
you both so,&rdquo; she remarked again. &ldquo;If I've said anythin'
that riled you, I'm sorry, I'm sure. As I said before, folks must do
as they are a mind to with their own children. If they see fit to
keep 'em home from school until they're women grown, and if they
think it's best not to punish 'em when they run away, why they must.
I 'ain't got no right to say anythin', and I 'ain't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; began Fanny, and then she stopped short,
and Eva began arranging her hair before the glass. &ldquo;The wind
blew so comin' home,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that my hair is all
out.&rdquo;  The visiting woman stared with a motion of adjustive
bewilderment, as one might before a sudden change of wind, then she
looked, as a shadowy motion disturbed the even light of the room and
little Ellen passed the window. She knew at once, for she had heard
the gossip, that the ready tongues of recrimination were hushed
because of the child, and then Ellen entered.</p>

<p>The winter afternoon was waning and the light was low; the child's
face, with its clear fairness, seemed to gleam out in the room like a
lamp with a pale luminosity of its own.</p>

<p>The three women, the mother, and aunt, and the visiting neighbor,
all looked at her, and Ellen smiled up at them as innocently sweet as
a flower. There was that in Ellen's smile and regard at that time
which no woman could resist. Suddenly the visiting neighbor laid a
finger softly under her chin and tilted up her little face towards
the light. Then she said with that unconscious poetry of bereavement
which sees a likeness in all fair things of earth to the face of the
lost treasure, &ldquo;I do believe she looks like my first little
girl that died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the visiting woman had gone, Fanny and Eva calling after her
to come again, they looked at each other, then at Ellen. &ldquo;That
little girl that died favored the Stebbinses, and was dark as an
Injun,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;no more like Ellen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; acquiesced Eva; &ldquo;I remember that
young one. Lookin' like Ellen&mdash;I'd like to see the child that
did look like her; there ain't none round these parts. I wish you
could have seen folks stare at her when I took her down street
yesterday. One woman said, &lsquo;Ain't she pretty as a
picture,&rsquo; so loud I heard it, but Ellen didn't seem
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I wonder if we'll make her proud,&rdquo; Fanny
said, in a hushed voice, with a look of admiration that savored of
worship at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She don't ever seem to notice,&rdquo; said Eva, with a
hushed response. Indeed, Ellen had seemed to pay no attention
whatever to their remarks, whether from an innate humility and lack
of self-consciousness, or because she was so accustomed to adulation
that it had become as the breath of her nostrils, to be taken no more
account of. She had seated herself in her favorite place in a
rocking-chair at a west window, with her chin resting on the sill,
and her eyes staring into the great out-of-doors, full of winds and
skies and trees and her own imaginings.</p>

<p>She would sit so, motionless, for hours at a time, and sometimes
her mother would rouse her almost roughly. &ldquo;What be you
thinkin' about, settin' there so still?&rdquo; she would ask, with
eyes of vague anxiety fixed upon her, but Ellen could never
answer.</p>

<p>Though it was getting late, it did not seem dark as early as
usual, since there was a full moon and there was snow on the ground
which gave forth a pale light in a wide surface of reflection.
However, the moon was behind clouds, for it was beginning to snow
again quite heavily, and the white flakes drove in whirlwinds past
the street-lamp on the corner of the street. Now and then a tramping
and muffled figure came into the radius of light, then passed into
the white gloom beyond.</p>

<p>Fanny was preparing supper, and the light from the dining-room
shone in where Ellen sat, but the sitting-room was not lighted. Ellen
began to smell the fragrance of tea and toast, and there was a
reflection of the dining-room table and lamp outside pictured vividly
against the white sheet of storm.</p>

<p>Ellen knew better, but it amused her to think that her home was
out-of-doors as well as under her father's and mother's roof. Eva
passed her with her hands full of kindlings. She was going to make a
fire in the parlor-stove, for Jim Tenny was coming that evening. She
laid a tender hand on Ellen's head as she passed, and smoothed her
hair. Ellen had a sort of acquiescent wonder over her aunt Eva in
those days. She heard people say Eva was getting ready to be married,
and speculated. &ldquo;What is getting ready to be married?&rdquo;
she asked Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, getting your clothes made, you little ninny,&rdquo;
Eva answered.</p>

<p>The next day Ellen had watched her mother at work upon a new
little frock for herself for some time before she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, you are making that new dress for me, ain't
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am; why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you made me a new coat last week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you know I did, Ellen; what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are going to make me a petticoat and put that
pretty lace on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I am, Ellen Brewster, what be you drivin'
at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be I a-gettin' ready to be married, mother?&rdquo; asked
Ellen, with the strangest look of wonder and awe and
anticipation.</p>

<p>Fanny had told this saying of the child's to everybody, and that
evening when Jim Tenny came he caught up Ellen and gave her a toss to
the ceiling, a trick of his which filled Ellen with a sort of fearful
delight, the delight of helplessness in the hands of strength, and
the titillation of evanescent risk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are gettin' ready to be married, are you?&rdquo; Jim
Tenny said, with a great laugh, looking at her soberly, with big
black eyes. Jim Tenny was a handsome fellow, and much larger and
stronger than her father. Ellen liked him; he often brought candies
in his pocket for her, and they were great friends, but she could
never understand why he stayed in the parlor all alone with her aunt
Eva, instead of in the sitting-room with the others.</p>

<p>Ellen had looked back at him as soberly. &ldquo;Mother says I
'ain't,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am getting most as many new clothes as Aunt Eva, and she
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you think maybe you are gettin' ready to be married,
after all, hey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think maybe mother wants to surprise me,&rdquo; Ellen
said.</p>

<p>Jim Tenny had all of a sudden shaken convulsively as if with
mirth, but his face remained perfectly sober.</p>

<p>That evening after the parlor door was closed upon Jim and Eva,
Ellen wondered what they were laughing at.</p>

<p>To-night when she saw Eva enter the room, a lighted lamp
illuminating her face fairly reckless with happiness, to light the
fire in the courting-stove as her sister facetiously called it, she
thought to herself that Jim Tenny was coming, that they would be shut
up in there all alone as usual, and then she looked out at the storm
and the night again, and the little home picture thrown against it.
Then she saw her father coming into the yard with his arms full of
parcels, and she was out of her chair and at the kitchen door to meet
him.</p>

<p>Andrew had brought as usual some dainties for his darling. He
watched Ellen unwrap the various parcels, not smiling as usual, but
with a curious knitting of his forehead and pitiful compression of
mouth. When she had finished and ran into the other room to show a
great orange to her aunt, he drew a heavy sigh that was almost a
groan. His wife coming in from the kitchen with a dish heard him, and
looked at him with quick anxiety, though she spoke in a merry,
rallying way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the land sake, Andrew Brewster, what be you groanin'
that way for?&rdquo; she cried out.</p>

<p>Andrew's tense face did not relax; he strove to push past her
without a word, but Fanny stood before him. &ldquo;Now, look at here,
Andrew,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you 'ain't goin' to walk off with a
face like that, unless I know what the matter is. Are you
sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I ain't sick, Fanny,&rdquo; Andrew said; then in a low
voice, &ldquo;Let me go, I will tell you by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Andrew, you have got to tell me now. I'm goin' to know
whatever has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till after supper, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can't wait. Look here, Andrew, you are my husband,
and there ain't no trouble that can come to you in this world that I
can't bear, except not knowin'. You've got to tell me what the matter
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, keep quiet till after supper, then,&rdquo; said
Andrew. Then suddenly he leaned his face close to her and whispered
with a hiss of tragedy, &ldquo;Lloyd's shut down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny recoiled and looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The foreman gave notice to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For how long? Did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, till business got better&mdash;same old story. Unless
I'm mistaken, Lloyd's will be shut down all winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it ain't so bad for us as for some,&rdquo; said
Fanny. Both pride and a wish to cheer her husband induced her to say
that. She did not like to think that, after the fine marriage she had
made, she needed to be as distressed at a temporary loss of
employment as others. Then, too, that look of overhanging melancholy
in Andrew's face alarmed her; she felt that she must drive it away at
any cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me it's bad enough for anybody,&rdquo; said
Andrew, morosely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Andrew, you know it ain't. Here we own the house
clear, and we've got that money in the savings-bank, and all that's
your mother's is yours in the end. Of course we ain't always thinkin'
of that, and I'm sure I hope she'll outlive me, but it's so. You know
we sha'n't starve if you don't have work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall starve in the end, and you know I've
been&mdash;&rdquo;  Andrew stopped suddenly as he heard Ellen and his
sister-in-law coming. He shook his head at his wife with a warning
motion that she should keep silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't Eva know?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she came out early. Do for Heaven's sake keep quiet
till after supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva was sharp-eyed, and all through supper she watched Andrew, and
the lines of melancholy on his face, which did not disappear even
when he forced conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in creation ails you, Andrew?&rdquo; she burst out,
finally. &ldquo;You look like a walking funeral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew made no reply, and Fanny volunteered an answer. &ldquo;He's
all tired out,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he's got a little cold. Eat
some more of the stew, Andrew; it'll do you good, it's nice and
hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can't cheat me,&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;There's
something to pay.&rdquo;  She took a mouthful, then she stared at
Andrew, with a sudden pallor. &ldquo;It ain't anythin' about Jim, is
it?&rdquo; she gasped out. &ldquo;Because if it is, there's no use in
your waitin' to tell me, you might as well have it over at once. You
won't make it any easier for me, I can tell you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it ain't anything about Jim, in the way you mean,
Eva,&rdquo; her sister said, soothingly. &ldquo;Eat your supper and
don't worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? Jim ain't sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I tell you; don't be a goose, Eva.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain't been anywhere with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do keep still, Eva!&rdquo; Fanny cried, impatiently.
&ldquo;If I didn't have any more faith than that in a man, I'd give
him up. I don't think you're fair to Jim. Of course he ain't been
with that girl, when he's goin' to marry you next month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm just as fair to Jim as he deserves,&rdquo; Eva said,
simply. &ldquo;I think just as much of him, but what a man's done
once he may do again, and I can't help it if I think of it, and he
shouldn't be surprised. He's brought it on himself. I've got as much
faith in him as anybody can have, seein' as he's a man. Well, if it
ain't that, Andrew Brewster, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you let him alone till after supper, Eva,&rdquo; Fanny
said. &ldquo;Do let him have a little peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll get it out of him afterwards,&rdquo; Eva
said.</p>

<p>As soon as she got up from the table she pushed him into the
sitting-room. &ldquo;Now, out with it,&rdquo; said she. Ellen, who
had followed them, stood looking at them both, her lips parted, her
eyes full of half-alarmed curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lloyd's has shut down, if you want to know,&rdquo; Andrew
said, shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo; cried Eva. Andrew shrank from her
impatiently. She made that ejaculation because she was a Loud, and
had an off-streak in her blood. Not one of Andrew's pure New England
stock would have so expressed herself. He sat down beside the lamp
and took up the evening paper. Eva stood looking at him a minute. She
was quite pale, she was weighing consequences. Then she went out to
her sister. &ldquo;Well, you know what's happened, Fan, I
s'pose,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I'm awful sorry, but I tell Andrew it ain't so bad for
us as for some; we sha'n't starve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know as I care much whether I starve or not,&rdquo;
said Eva. &ldquo;It's goin' to make me put off my weddin'; and if I
do put it off, Jim and me will never get married at all; I feel it in
my bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what should you have to put it off for?&rdquo; asked
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? I should think you'd know why without askin'. Ain't I
spent every dollar I have saved up on my weddin' fixin's, and Jim,
he's got his mother on his hands, and she's been sick, and he ain't
saved up anything. If you s'pose I'm goin' to marry him and make him
any worse off than he is now you're mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mebbe Jim can work somewhere else, and mebbe Lloyd's
won't be shut up long,&rdquo; Fanny said, consolingly. &ldquo;I
wouldn't give up so, if I was you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might jest as well,&rdquo; Eva returned. &ldquo;It's no
use, Jim and me will never get married.&rdquo;  Eva's face was
curiously set; she was not in the least loud nor violent as was
usually the case when she was in trouble, her voice was quite low,
and she spoke slowly.</p>

<p>Fanny looked anxiously at her. &ldquo;It ain't as though you
hadn't a roof to cover you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for you've got
mine and Andrew's as long as we have one ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I'd live on Andrew long?&rdquo; demanded
Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won't have to. Jim will get work in a week or two, and
you'll get married. Don't act so. I declare, I'm ashamed of you, Eva
Loud. I thought you had more sense, to give up discouraged at no more
than this. I don't see why you jump way ahead into trouble before you
get to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got to it, and I can feel the steam of it in my
face,&rdquo; Eva said, with unconscious imagery. Then she lit a lamp,
and went up-stairs to change her dress before Jim Tenny arrived.</p>

<p>It was snowing hard. Ellen sat in her place by the window and
watched the flakes drive past the radiance of the street-lamp on the
corner, and past the reflection of the warm, bright room. Now she
could see, since the light was in the room where she sat, her father
beside the table reading his paper, and shadowy images of all the
familiar things projecting themselves like a mirage of home into the
night and storm. Ellen could see, even without turning round, that
her father looked very sober, and did not seem to be much interested
in his paper, and a vague sense of calamity oppressed her. She did
not know just what might be involved in Lloyd's shutting down, but
she saw that her father and aunt were disturbed, and her imaginings
were half eclipsed by a shadow of material things. Ellen dearly loved
this early evening hour when she could stare out into the mystery of
the night, herself sheltered under the wing of home, and the fancies
which her childish brain wove were as a garment of spirit for the
future; but to-night she did not dream so much as she wondered and
reflected. Pretty soon Ellen saw a man's figure plodding through the
fast-gathering snow, and heard her aunt Eva make a soft, heavy rush
down the front stairs, and she knew the man was Jim Tenny, and her
aunt had been watching for him. Ellen wondered why she had watched up
in her cold room, why she had not sat down-stairs where it was warm,
and let Jim ring the door-bell. Ellen liked Jim Tenny, but there was
often that in her aunt's eyes regarding him which made Ellen look
past him and above him to see if there was another man there. Ellen
heard the fire crackling in the parlor-stove, and saw the light
shining under the parlor threshold, and heard the soft hum of voices.
Her mother, having finished washing up the supper dishes, came in
presently and seated herself beside the lamp with her
needle-work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't feel any wind comin' in the window?&rdquo; she
said, anxiously, to Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>Andrew looked up quickly. &ldquo;You're sure you don't?&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen watched her mother sewing out in the snowy yard, then a dark
shadow came between the reflection and the window, then another. Two
men treading in the snow in even file, one in the other's
foot-tracks, came into the yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody's comin',&rdquo; said Ellen, as a knock, came on
the side door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see who 'twas?&rdquo; Fanny asked, starting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's somebody to see you, Andrew,&rdquo; Fanny said, and
Andrew tossed his paper on the table and went to the door.</p>

<p>When the door was opened Ellen heard a man cough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think anybody was crazy to come out such a night
as this, coughin' that way,&rdquo; murmured Fanny. &ldquo;I do
believe it's Joe Atkins; sounds like his cough.&rdquo;  Then Andrew
entered with the two men stamping and shaking themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here's Joseph Atkins and Nahum Beals,&rdquo; Andrew said,
in his melancholy voice, all unstirred by the usual warmth of
greeting. The two men bowed stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evenin',&rdquo; Fanny said, and rose and pushed
forward the rocking-chair in which she had been seated to Joseph
Atkins, who was a consumptive man with an invalid wife, and worked
next Andrew in Lloyd's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your settin', keep your settin',&rdquo; he returned in
his quick, nervous way, as if his very words were money for dire
need, and sat himself down in a straight chair far from the fire. The
other man, Nahum Beals, was very young. He seated himself next to
Joseph, and the two side by side looked with gloomy significance at
Andrew and Fanny. Then Joseph Atkins burst out suddenly in a rattling
volley of coughs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hadn't ought to come out such a night as this, I'm
afraid, Mr. Atkins,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's been out jest as bad weather as this all
winter,&rdquo; said the young man, Nahum Beals, in an unexpectedly
deep voice. &ldquo;The workers of this world can't afford to take no
account of weather. It's for the rich folks to look out betwixt their
lace curtains and see if it looks lowery, so they sha'n't git their
gold harnesses and their shiny carriages, an' their silks an' velvets
an' ostrich feathers wet. The poor folks that it's life and death to
have to go out whether or no, no matter if they've got an extra suit
of clothes or not. They've got to go out through the drenchin' rain
and the snow-drifts, to earn money so that the rich folks can have
them gold-plated harnesses and them silks and velvets. Joe's been out
all winter in weather as bad as this, after he's been standin' all
day in a shop as hot as hell, drenched with sweat. One more time
won't make much difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be 'nough sight better for me if it did,&rdquo;
said Joseph Atkins, chokingly, and still with that same seeming of
hurry.</p>

<p>Fanny had gone out to the dining-room, and now she returned
stirring some whiskey and molasses in a cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you take this, Mr. Atkins;
it's real good for a cough. Andrew cured a cold with it last
month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine ain't a cold, and it can't be cured in this world, but
it's better for me, I guess,&rdquo; said Joe Atkins, chokingly, but
he took the cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you hadn't ought to talk so,&rdquo; Fanny said.
&ldquo;You had ought to think of your wife and children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My life is insured,&rdquo; said Joseph Atkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain't got no money and no jewelry, and no silver to
leave them we love&mdash;all we've got to leave 'em is the price of
our own lives,&rdquo; said Nahum Beals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had got my life insured,&rdquo; Andrew said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't talk so, Andrew,&rdquo; Fanny cried, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My life is insured for two thousand dollars,&rdquo; Joe
Atkins said, with an odd sort of pride. &ldquo;I had it done three
years ago. My lungs was sound as anybody's then, but that very next
summer I worked up under that tin roof, and came out as wet as if I'd
been dipped in the river, into an east wind, and got a chill. It was
the only time I ever struck luck&mdash;to get insured before that
happened. Nobody'd look at me now, and I dunno what they'd do. I
'ain't laid up a cent, I've had so much sickness in my
family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you hadn't worked that summer in the annex under that
tin roof, you'd be as well as you ever was now,&rdquo; said Nahum
Beals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I worked there 'longside of you that summer,&rdquo; said
Andrew to Joe, with bitter reminiscence. &ldquo;We used to strip like
a gang of convicts, and we stood in pools of sweat. It was that awful
hot summer, and the room had only that one row of windows facing the
east, and the wind never that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till I came out of the shop that night I took the
chill,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young man, Nahum Beals, hit his knees a sounding
slap, which made Ellen, furtively and timidly attentive at her
window, jump. &ldquo;It seems sometimes as if the Almighty himself
was in league with 'em,&rdquo; he shouted out, &ldquo;but I tell you
it won't last, it won't last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see much sign of any change for the better,&rdquo;
Andrew said, gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, sir, it won't last,&rdquo; repeated Nahum
Beals. &ldquo;I tell you, the Lord only raises 'em up higher and
higher that He may dash 'em lower when the time comes. The same earth
is beneath the high places of this life, and the lowly ones, and the
law that governs 'em is the same, and&mdash;the higher the place the
longer the fall, and the longer the fall the sorer the hurt.&rdquo;
Nahum Beals sprang to his feet with a strange abandon of
self-consciousness and a fiery impetus for one of his New England
blood. He had a delicate, nervous face, like a woman's, his blue eyes
gleamed like blue flames under his overhang of white forehead, he
shook his head as if it were maned like a lion, and, though he wore
his thin, fair hair short, one could seem to see it flung back in
glistening lines. He spread his hands as if he were addressing an
audience, and as he did so the parlor door opened and Jim Tenny and
Eva stood there, listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, sir,&rdquo; shouted Nahum Beals, &ldquo;the
time will come when you will all thank God that you belong to the
poor and down-trodden of this earth, and not to the rich and
great&mdash;the time will come. There's knives to sharpen to-day, and
wood for scaffolds as plenty as in the days of the French Revolution,
and the hand that marks the time of day on the clock of men's
patience with wrong and oppression has near gone round to the same
hour and minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew Brewster looked at him, with a curious expression half of
disgust, half of sympathy. His sense of dignity in the face of
adversity inherited from his New England race was shocked; he was not
one to be blindly swayed by another's fervor even when his own wrongs
were in question. He would not have made a good follower in a
revolution, nor a leader. He would simply have found his own place of
fixed principle and abided there. Then, too, he had a judicial mind
which could combine the elements of counsels for and against his own
cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look at here,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;I ain't
goin' to say I don't think we ain't in a hard place, and that there's
somethin' wrong that's to blame for it, but I dunno but you go most
too far, Nahum; or, rather, I dunno as you go far enough. I dunno but
we've got to dig down past the poor and the rich, farther into the
everlastin' foundations of things to get at what's the
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Tenny, standing in the parlor doorway, with an arm around
Eva's waist, broke in suddenly with a defiant laugh. &ldquo;I don't
care nothin' about the everlastin' foundations of things, and I don't
care a darn about the rich and the poor,&rdquo; he proclaimed.
&ldquo;I'm willin' to leave that to lecturers and dynamiters, and let
'em settle it if they can. I don't grudge the rich nothin', and I
ain't goin' to call the Almighty to account for givin' somebody else
the biggest piece of pie; mebbe it would give me the stomach-ache.
All I'm concerned about is Lloyd's shut-down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, sir, it ain't the facts of the case, but the
reason for the facts, which we must think of,&rdquo; maintained Nahum
Beals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care a darn for the facts nor the reasons,&rdquo;
said Jim Tenny; &ldquo;all I care about is I'm out of work maybe till
spring, with my mother dependent on me, and not a cent laid up, I've
been so darned careless, and here's Eva says she won't marry me till
I get work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't,&rdquo; said Eva, who was very pale, except for
burning spots on her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's afraid she won't get frostin' on her cake, and silk
dresses, I expect,&rdquo; Jim Tenny said, and laughed, but his laugh
was very bitter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim Tenny, you know better than that,&rdquo; Eva cried,
sharply. &ldquo;I won't stand that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Tenny, with a quick motion, unwound his arm from Eva's waist
and stripped up his sleeve. &ldquo;There, look at that, will
you,&rdquo; he cried out, shaking his lean, muscular arm at them;
&ldquo;look at that muscle, and me tellin' her that I could earn a
livin' for her, and she afraid. I can dig if I can't make shoes. I
guess there's work in this world for them that's willin', and don't
pick and choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain't,&rdquo; declared Nahum, shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can't dig when the ground's froze hard,&rdquo; Eva
said, with literal meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'll take a pickaxe,&rdquo; cried Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can dig, but who's goin' to pay you for the
diggin'?&rdquo; demanded Nahum Beals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea of a girl's bein' afraid I wa'n't enough of a man
to support a wife with an arm like that,&rdquo; said Jim Tenny,
&ldquo;as if I couldn't dig for her, or fight for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fightin' has got to come first in order to get the
diggin', and the pay for it,&rdquo; said Nahum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look at here,&rdquo; Andrew Brewster broke in,
&ldquo;you know I'm in as bad a box as you, and I come home to-night
feelin' as if I didn't care whether I lived or died; but if it's true
what McGrath said to-night, we've got to use common-sense in lookin'
at things even if it goes against us. If what McGrath said was true,
that Lloyd's losing money keeping on, I dunno how we can expect him
or any other man to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not he lose money as well as we?&rdquo; demanded Nahum,
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Cause we 'ain't got none to lose,&rdquo; cried Jim Tenny,
with a hard laugh, and Eva and Fanny echoed him hysterically.</p>

<p>Nahum took no notice of the interruption. Tragedy, to his
comprehension, never verged on comedy. One could imagine his face of
intense melancholy and denunciation relaxed with laughter no more
than that of the stern prophet of righteous retribution whose name he
bore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn't Norman Lloyd lose money?&rdquo; he demanded
again. &ldquo;Why shouldn't he lose his fine house as well as I my
poor little home? Why shouldn't he lose his purple and fine linen as
well as Jim his chances of happiness? Why shouldn't he lose his
diamond shirt-studs, and his carriage and horses, as well as Joe his
life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he earned his money, I suppose,&rdquo; Andrew said,
slowly, &ldquo;and I suppose it's for him to say what he'll do with
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Earned his money? He didn't earn his money,&rdquo; cried
Nahum Beals. &ldquo;We earned it, every dollar of it, by the sweat of
our brows, and it's for us, not him, to say what shall be done with
it. Well, the time will come, I tell ye, the time will
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sha'n't see it,&rdquo; said Joe Atkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may come sooner than you think,&rdquo; said Nahum. Then
Nahum Beals, with a sudden access of bitterness, broke in.
&ldquo;Look at Norman Lloyd,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;havin' that
great house, and horses and carriages, and dressin' like a dude, and
his wife rustlin' in silks so you can hear her comin' a mile off, and
shinin' like a jeweller's window&mdash;look at 'em all&mdash;all the
factory bosses&mdash;livin' like princes on the money we've earned
for 'em; and look at their relations, and look at the rich folks that
ain't never earned a cent, that's had money left 'em. Go right up and
down the Main Street, here in this city. See the Lloyds and the
Maguires and the Marshalls and the Risleys and the
Lennoxes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain't none of the Lennoxes left except that one
woman,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look at her. There she is without chick or child,
rollin' in riches, and Norman Lloyd's her own brother-in-law. Why
don't she give him a little money to run the factory this winter, so
you and me won't have to lose everythin'?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she's got a right to do as she pleases with her
own,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you she ain't,&rdquo; shouted Nahum. &ldquo;She
ain't the one to say, &lsquo;It's the Lord, and He's said it.&rsquo;
Cynthia Lennox and all the women like her are the oppressors of the
poor. They are accursed in the sight of the Lord, as were those women
we read about in the Old Testament, with their mantles and
crisping-pins. Their low voices and their silk sweeps and their
shrinkin' from touchin' shoulders with their fellow-beings in a crowd
don't alter matters a mite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Nahum,&rdquo; cried Jim Tenny, with one of his sudden
turns of base when his sense of humor was touched, &ldquo;you don't
mean to say that you want Cynthia Lennox to give you her
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd die, and see her dead, before I'd touch a dollar of her
money!&rdquo; cried Nahum&mdash;&ldquo;before I'd touch a dollar of
her money or anything that was bought with her money, her money or
any other rich person's. I want what I earn. I don't want a gift with
a curse on it. Let her keep her fine things. She and her kind are
responsible for all the misery of the poor on the face of the
earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me you're reasonin' in a circle, Nahum,&rdquo;
Andrew said, good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Andrew, if you're on the side of the rich, why
don't you say so?&rdquo; cried Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain't,&rdquo; returned Fanny&mdash;&ldquo;you know
better, Eva Loud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I ain't,&rdquo; declared Andrew. &ldquo;You all of you
know I'm with the class I belong to; I ain't a toady to no rich
folks; I don't think no more of 'em than you do, and I don't want any
favors of 'em&mdash;all I want is pay for my honest work, and that's
an even swap, and I ain't beholden, but I want to look at things fair
and square. I don't want to be carried away because I'm out of work,
though, God knows, it's hard enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what's goin' to become of us,&rdquo; said
Joseph Atkins&mdash;then he coughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; Jim Tenny said, bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And God knows I don't,&rdquo; cried Eva, and she sat down
in the nearest chair, flung up her hands before her face, and
wept.</p>

<p>Then Fanny spoke to Ellen, who had been sitting very still and
attentive, her eyes growing larger, her cheeks redder with
excitement. Fanny had often glanced uneasily at her, and wished to
send her to bed, but she was in the habit of warming Ellen's little
chamber at the head of the stairs by leaving open the sitting-room
door for a while before she went to it, and she was afraid of cooling
the room too much for Joseph Atkins, and had not ventured to
interrupt the conversation. Now, seeing the child's fevered face, she
made up her mind. &ldquo;Come, Ellen, it's your bed-time,&rdquo; she
said, and Ellen rose reluctantly, and, kissing her father, she went
to her aunt Eva, who caught at her convulsively and kissed her, and
sobbed against her cheek. &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; she wailed,
&ldquo;you precious little thing, you precious little thing, I don't
know what's goin' to become of us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't, Eva,&rdquo; said Fanny, sharply; &ldquo;can't you
see she's all wrought up? She hadn't ought to have heard all this
talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew looked anxiously at his wife, rose, and caught up Ellen in
his arms with a hug of fervent and protective love. &ldquo;Don't you
worry, father's darlin',&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Don't you worry
about anythin' you have heard. Father will always have enough to take
care of you with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Tenny, when Andrew set the child down, caught her up again
with a sounding kiss. &ldquo;Don't you let your big ears ache, you
little pitcher,&rdquo; said he, with a gay laugh. &ldquo;Little
doll-babies like you haven't anythin' to worry about if Lloyd's shut
down every day in the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're the very ones whom it concerns,&rdquo; said Nahum
Beals, when Ellen and her mother had gone up-stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn't have had that little nervous thing hear
all this, if I'd thought,&rdquo; Andrew said, anxiously.</p>

<p>Joseph Atkins, whom Fanny had stationed in a sheltered corner near
the stove when she opened the door, peered around at Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems as if she was too young to get much sense of
it,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;My Maria, that's her age,
wouldn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen hears everything and makes her own sense of
it,&rdquo; said Andrew, &ldquo;and the Lord only knows what she's
made of this. I hope she won't fret over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish my tongue had been cut off before I said anything
before her,&rdquo; cried Eva. &ldquo;I know just what that child is.
She'll find out what a hard world she's in soon enough, anyway, and I
don't want to be the one to open her eyes ahead of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen went to bed quietly, and her mother did not think she had
paid much attention to what had been going on, and said so when she
went down-stairs after Ellen had been kissed and tucked in bed and
the lamp put out. &ldquo;I guess she didn't mind much about it, after
all,&rdquo; she said to Andrew. &ldquo;I guess the room was pretty
warm, and that was what made her cheeks so red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen, after her mother left her, turned her little head
towards the wall and wept softly, lest some one hear her, but none
the less bitterly that she had no right conception of the cause of
her grief. There was over her childish soul the awful shadow of the
labor and poverty of the world. She knew naught of the substance
behind the shadow, but the darkness terrified her all the more, and
she cried and cried as if her heart would break. Then she, with a
sudden resolution, born she could not have told of what strange
understanding and misunderstanding of what she had heard that
evening, slipped out of bed, groped about until she found her
cherished doll, sitting in her little chair in the corner. She was
accustomed to take the doll to bed with her, and had undressed her
for that purpose early in the evening, but she had climbed into bed
and left her sitting in the corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you want your dolly?&rdquo; her mother had asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am; I guess I don't want her to-night,&rdquo; Ellen
had replied, with a little break in her voice. Now, when she reached
the doll, she gathered her up in her little arms, and groped her way
with her into the closet. She hugged the doll, and kissed her wildly,
then she shook her. &ldquo;You have been naughty,&rdquo; she
whispered&mdash;&ldquo;yes, you have, dreadful naughty. No, don't you
talk to me; you have been naughty. What right had you to be livin'
with rich folks, and wearin' such fine things, when other children
don't have anything. What right had that little boy that was your
mother before I was, and that rich lady that gave you to me? They had
ought to be put in the closet, too. God had ought to put them all in
the closet, the way I'm goin' to put you. Don't you say a word; you
needn't cry; you've been dreadful naughty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen set the doll, face to the wall, in the corner of the closet,
and left her there. Then she crept back into bed, and lay there
crying over her precious baby shivering in her thin night-gown all
alone in the dark closet. But she was firm in keeping her there,
since, with that strange, involuntary grasp of symbolism which has
always been maintained by the baby-fingers of humanity for the
satisfying of needs beyond resources and the solving of problems
outside knowledge, she had a conviction that she was, in such
fashion, righting wrong and punishing evil. But she wept over the
poor doll until she fell asleep.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter X</h3>

<p>When Ellen woke the next morning she had a curious feeling, as if
she were blinded by the glare of many hitherto unsuspected windows
opening into the greatness outside the little world, just large
enough to contain them, in which she had dwelt all her life with her
parents, her aunt, her grandmother, and her doll. She tried to adjust
herself to her old point of view with her simple childish recognition
of the most primitive facts as a basis for dreams, but she remembered
what Mr. Atkins, who coughed so dreadfully, had said the night
before; she remembered what the young man with the bulging forehead,
who frightened her terribly, had said; she remembered the gloomy look
in her father's face, the misery in her aunt Eva's; and she
remembered her doll in the closet&mdash;and either everything was
different or had a different light upon it. In reality Ellen's
evening in the sound and sight of that current of rebellion against
the odds of life which has taken the poor off their foot hold of
understanding since the beginning of the world had aged her. She had
lost something out of her childhood. She dreaded to go down-stairs;
she had a feeling of shamefacedness struggling within her; she was
afraid that her father and mother would look at her sharply, then
look again, and ask her what the matter was, and she would not know
what to say. When she went down, and backed about for her mother to
fasten her little frock as was her wont, she was careful to keep her
face turned away; but Fanny caught her up and kissed her in her usual
way, and then her aunt Eva sung out to know if she wanted to go on a
sleigh-ride, and had she seen the snow; and then her father came in
and that look of last night had gone from his face, and Ellen was her
old self again until she was alone by herself and remembered.</p>

<p>Fanny and Andrew and Eva had agreed to say nothing before the
child about the shutting-up of Lloyd's, and their troubles in
consequence. &ldquo;She heard too much last night,&rdquo; Andrew
said; &ldquo;there's no use in her botherin' her little head with it.
I guess that baby won't suffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's jest the child to fret herself most to pieces
thinkin' we were awful poor, and she would starve or
somethin',&rdquo; Fanny said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she sha'n't be worried if I can help it, no matter
what happens to me,&rdquo; Eva said.</p>

<p>After breakfast that morning Eva went to work on a little dress of
Ellen's. When Fanny told her not to spend her time over that, when
she had so much sewing of her own to do, Eva replied with a gay, hard
laugh, that she guessed she'd wait and finish her weddin'-fix when
she was goin' to be married.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva Loud, you ain't goin' to be so silly as to put off your
weddin',&rdquo; Fanny cried out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno as I've put it off; I dunno as I want to get
married, anyhow,&rdquo; Eva said, still laughing. &ldquo;I dunno, but
I'd rather be old maid aunt to Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva Loud,&rdquo; cried her sister; &ldquo;do you know what
you are doin'?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, I reckon,&rdquo; said Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that if you put off Jim Tenny, and he not
likin' it, ten chances to one Aggie Bemis will get hold of him
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Eva, &ldquo;let her. I won't have been
the one to drag him into misery, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you can feel that way,&rdquo; Fanny returned,
looking at her sister with a sort of mixed admiration and pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can. I tell you what 'tis, Fanny. When I look at Jim,
handsome and head up in the air, and think how he'd look all bowed
down, hair turnin' gray, and not carin' whether he's shaved and has
on a clean shirt or not, 'cause he's got loaded down with debt, and
the grocery-man and the butcher after him, and no work, and me and
the children draggin' him down, I can bear anything. If another girl
wants to do it, she must, though I'd like to kill her when I think of
it. I can't do it, because&mdash;I think too much of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might lose his work after he was married, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we'd have to run the risk of that; but I'm
goin' to start fair or not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe he'll get work,&rdquo; Fanny said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won't,&rdquo; said Eva. She began to sing &ldquo;Nancy
Lee&rdquo; over Ellen's dress.</p>

<p>After breakfast Ellen begged a piece of old brown calico of her
mother. &ldquo;Why, of course you can have it, child,&rdquo; said her
mother; &ldquo;but what on earth do you want it for? I was goin' to
put it in the rag-bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to make my dolly a dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that ain't fit for your dolly's dress. Only think how
queer that beautiful doll would look in a dress made of that. Why,
you 'ain't thought anything but silk and satin was good enough for
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll give you a piece of my new blue silk to make your doll
a dress,&rdquo; said Eva.</p>

<p>But Ellen persisted. When the doll came out of her closet of
vicarious penance she was arrayed like a very scullion among dolls,
in the remnant of the dress in which Fanny Brewster had done her
house-work all summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Ellen told the doll, when her mother did not
hear &ldquo;you look more like the way you ought to, and you ought to
be happy, and not ever think you wish you had your silk dress on.
Think of all the poor children who never have any silk dresses, or
any dresses at all&mdash;nothing except their cloth bodies in the
coldest weather. You ought to be thankful to have this.&rdquo;  For
all which good advice and philosophy the little mother of the doll
would often look at the discarded beauty of the wardrobe, with tears
in her eyes and fondest pity in her heart; but she never flinched.
When the young man Nahum Beals came in, as he often did of an
evening, and raised his voice in fierce denunciation against the
luxury and extravagance of the rich, Ellen would listen and consider
that he would undoubtedly approve of what she had done, did he know,
and would allow that she had made her small effort towards righting
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only think what Mr. Beals would say if he saw you in your
silk dress; why, I don't know but he would throw you out of the
window,&rdquo; she told her doll once.</p>

<p>Ellen did not feel any difference in her way of living after her
father was out of work. &ldquo;She ain't goin' to be stented in one
single thing; remember that,&rdquo; Andrew told Fanny, with angry
emphasis. &ldquo;That little, delicate thing is goin' to have
everything she needs, if I spend every cent I've saved and mortgage
the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you'll get work before it comes to that,&rdquo; Fanny
said, consolingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether I do or not, it sha'n't make any difference,&rdquo;
declared Andrew. &ldquo;I'm goin' to hire a horse and sleigh and take
her sleigh-ridin' this afternoon. It'll be good, and she's been
talkin' about a sleigh-ride ever since snow flew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could do without that,&rdquo; Fanny said,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she ain't goin' to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it happened that the very day after Lloyd's had shut down, when
every man out of employment felt poorer than he did later when he had
grown accustomed to the sensation of no money coming in, Andrew
Brewster hired a horse and double sleigh, and took Ellen, her mother,
grandmother, and aunt out sleigh-riding. Ellen sat on the back seat
of the sleigh, full of that radiant happiness felt by a child whose
pleasures have not been repeated often enough for satiety. The sleigh
slid over the blue levels of snow followed by long creaks like wakes
of sound, when the livery-stable horse shook his head proudly and set
his bells in a flurry. Ellen drew a long breath of rapture. These
unaccustomed sounds held harmonies of happiness which would echo
through her future, for no one can estimate the immortality of some
little delight of a child. In all her life, Ellen never forgot that
sleigh-ride. It was a very cold day, and the virgin snow did not melt
at all; the wind blew a soft, steady pressure from the west, and its
wings were evident from the glistening crystals which were lifted and
borne along. The trees held their shining boughs against the blue of
the sky, and burned and blazed here and there as with lamps of
diamonds. The child looked at them, and they lit her soul. Her little
face, between the swan's-down puffs of her hood, deepened in color
like a rose; her blue eyes shone; she laughed and dimpled silently;
she was in too much bliss to speak. The others kept looking at her,
then at one another. Fanny nudged her mother-in-law, behind the
child's back, and the two women exchanged glances of confidential
pride. Andrew and Eva kept glancing around at her, and asking if she
were having a good time. Eva was smartly dressed in her best hat, gay
with bows and red wings bristling as sharply as the head-dress of an
Indian chief in the old pictures. She had a red coat, and a long fur
boa wound around her throat; the clear crimson of her cheeks, her
great black eyes, and her heavy black braids were so striking that
people whom they met looked long at her. Eva talked fast to Andrew,
and laughed often and loudly.</p>

<p>Whenever that strident laugh of hers rang out, Mrs. Zelotes
Brewster, on the seat behind, moved her be-shawled shoulders with a
shivering hunch of disgust. &ldquo;Can't you tell that girl not to
laugh so loud when we're out ridin',&rdquo; she said to her son that
evening; &ldquo;I saw folks lookin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, mother,&rdquo; Andrew said; &ldquo;the poor
girl's got a good deal on her mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean that Tinny feller,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Zelotes, alluding to something which had happened that afternoon in
the course of the sleigh-ride.</p>

<p>The sleighing that day was excellent, for there had been an ice
coating on the road before, and the last not very heavy snowfall had
been just enough. The Brewsters passed and met many others: young men
out with their sweethearts, whole families drawn by the sober old
horse as old as the grown-up children; rakish young men driving
stable teams, leaning forward with long circles of whip over the
horses' backs, leaving the scent of cigars behind them; and often,
too, two young ladies in dainty turnouts; and sometimes two girls or
four girls from Lloyd's, who had clubbed together and hired a sleigh,
taking reckless advantage of their enforced vacation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's Daisy and Hat Sears, and&mdash;and there's Nell
White and Eaat Ryoce in the team behind,&rdquo; Eva said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think they better be savin' their money if Lloyd's
has shut up,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain't savin' ours, or Andrew ain't,&rdquo; Eva retorted,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's different with us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, proudly,
&ldquo;though I shouldn't think it was right for Andrew to hire a
team every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think folks might just as well have a little as
they're goin' along, for half the time they never seem to get
there,&rdquo; Eva said, with another hard laugh at her own wit; and
just then she saw something which made her turn deathly white, and
catch her breath with a gasp in spite of herself, though that was
all. She held up her head like a queen and turned her handsome white
face full towards Jim Tenny and the girl for whom he had jilted her
before, as they drove past, and bowed and smiled in a fashion which
made the red flame up over the young man's swarthy cheek, and the
pretty girl at his side shrink a little and avert her tousled fair
head with a nervous giggle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes Brewster twisted herself about and looked after them.
&ldquo;There's John Tibbets and his wife in that sleigh; he's thrown
out of work as well as you, Andrew,&rdquo; said Fanny, hastily.
&ldquo;See that feather in her bonnet blow; it's standin' up
straight.&rdquo;  But Fanny's man&oelig;uvre to turn the attention of
her mother-in-law was of no avail, for nothing short of sudden death
could interpose an effectual barrier between Mrs. Zelotes Brewster's
tongue and mind set with the purpose of speech. &ldquo;Was that the
Tinny fellow?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I guess so. I didn't notice in particular,&rdquo;
Fanny replied, in a low voice. Then she added, pointing to an
advancing sleigh. &ldquo;Good land, there's that Smith girl. They
said she wasn't able to ride out. Seems to me she's taken a queer day
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that that Tinny fellow?&rdquo; Mrs. Zelotes asked
again. She leaned forward and gave Eva a hard nudge on her red-coated
elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; Eva answered, calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was that girl with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Aggie Bemis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes gave a sniff, then she settled back, studying Eva's
back with a sort of reflective curiosity. Presently she fumbled under
the sleigh cushion for an extra shawl which she had brought, and
handed it up to Eva. &ldquo;Don't you want this extra shawl?&rdquo;
she asked, while Fanny stared at her wonderingly. Mrs. Zelotes's
civilities towards her sister had been few and far between.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; Eva replied, with a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn't you better? It must be pretty cold sitting up there.
You must take all the wind. You can wrap this shawl all around your
face and ears, and I don't want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you; I'm plenty warm,&rdquo; Eva replied. She
swallowed hard, and set her mouth hard. There was something about
this kindness of her old disapprover which touched her deeply, and
moved her to weakness more than had the sight of her recreant love
with another girl. Fanny saw the little quiver pass over her sister's
face, and leaned over and whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't be a mite surprised if that girl asked Jim to
take her. It would be just like her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don't make any odds whether she did or not,&rdquo;
returned Eva, with no affectation of secrecy. &ldquo;I don't care
which way 'twas.&rdquo;  She sat up straighter than ever, and some
men in a passing sleigh turned to look after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s'pose she don't think my shawl looks genteel enough to
wear,&rdquo; Mrs. Zelotes said to Fanny; &ldquo;but she's dreadful
silly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drove through the main street of the city and passed Cynthia
Lennox's house. Ellen looked at it with the guilt of secrecy. She
thought she saw the lady's head at a front window, and the front door
opened and Cynthia came down the walk with a rich sweep of black
draperies, and the soft sable toss of plumes. &ldquo;There's Cynthia
Lennox,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;She's a handsome-lookin' woman,
ain't she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's most as old as Andrew, but you'd never suspect
it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes. She had used to have a fancy that
Andrew and Cynthia might make a match. She had seen no reason to the
contrary, and she always looked at Cynthia with a curious sense of
injury and resentment when she thought of what might have been.</p>

<p>As Cynthia Lennox swept down the walk to-day, the old lady said,
sharply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see why she should walk any prouder than anybody
else. I don't know why she should, if she's right-minded. The
Lennoxes wasn't any grander than the Brewsters way back, if they have
got a little more money of late years. Cynthia's grandfather, old
Squire Lennox, used to keep the store, and live in one side of it,
and her mother's father, Calvin Goodenough, kept the tavern. I dunno
as she has so much to be proud of, though she's handsome enough, and
shows her bringin' up, as folks can't that ain't had it.&rdquo;
Fanny winced a little; her bringing up was a sore subject with
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, folks can't help their bringin' up,&rdquo; she
retorted, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's Lloyd's team,&rdquo; Andrew said, quickly, partly
to avert the impending tongue-clash between his wife and mother.</p>

<p>He reined his horse to one side at a respectful distance, and
Norman H. Lloyd, with his wife at his side, swept by in his fine
sleigh, streaming on the wind with black fur tails, his pair of bays
stepping high to the music of their arches of bells. The Brewsters
eyed Norman Lloyd's Russian coat with the wide sable collar turned up
around his proud, clear-cut face, the fur-gauntleted hands which held
the lines and the whip, for Mr. Lloyd preferred to drive his own
blooded pair, both from a love of horseflesh and a greater confidence
in his own guidance than in that of other people. Mr. Lloyd was no
coward, but he would have confided to no man his sensations had he
sat behind those furnaces of fiery motion with other hands than his
own upon the lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think Mis' Lloyd would be afraid to ride with such
horses,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, as they leaped aside in passing;
then she bowed and smiled with eager pleasure, and yet with perfect
self-respect. She felt herself every whit as good as Mrs. Norman
Lloyd, and her handsome Paisley shawl and velvet bonnet as genteel as
the other woman's sealskins and floating plumes. Mrs. Lloyd loomed up
like a vast figure of richness enveloped in her bulky winter wraps;
her face was superb with health and enjoyment and good-humor. Her
cheeks were a deep crimson in the cold wind; she smiled radiantly all
the time as if at life itself. She had no thought of fear behind
those prancing bays which seemed so frightful to Mrs. Zelotes, used
to the steadiest stable team a few times during the year, and driven
with a wary eye to railroad crossings and a sense of one's mortality
in the midst of life strong upon her. Mrs. Norman Lloyd had never any
doubt when her husband held the lines. She would have smiled behind
ostriches and zebras. To her mind Norman Lloyd was, as it were,
impregnable to all combinations of alien strength or circumstances.
When she bowed on passing the Brewsters, she did not move her fixed
smile until she caught sight of Ellen. Then emotion broke through the
even radiance of her face. She moved her head with a flurry of nods;
she waved her hand; she even kissed it to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bow to Mis' Lloyd, Ellen,&rdquo; said her grandmother; and
Ellen ducked her head solemnly. She remembered what she had heard the
night before, and the sleigh swept by, Mrs. Lloyd's rosy face smiling
back over the black fringe of dancing tails. Eva had shot a swift
glance of utmost rancor at the Lloyds, then sat stiff and upright
until they passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't ask Ellen to bow to that woman,&rdquo; said she,
fiercely, between her teeth. &ldquo;I hate the whole
tribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one heard her except Andrew, and he shook the lines over the
steady stable horse, and said, &ldquo;G'lang!&rdquo; hoarsely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman Lloyd, in the other sleigh, had turned to her husband
with somewhat timid and deprecating enthusiasm. &ldquo;Ain't she a
sweet little girl?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What little girl?&rdquo; Lloyd asked, abstractedly. He had
not looked at the Brewsters at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That little Ellen Brewster who ran away and was gone most
three days a little while ago. She was in that sleigh we just passed.
She is just the sweetest child I ever laid eyes on,&rdquo; and Norman
Lloyd smiled vaguely and coldly, and cast a glance over his
sable-clad shoulders to see how far behind the team whose approaching
bells he heard might be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose her father and aunt are out of work on account of
the closing of the factory,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Lloyd, and a shadow
of reflection came over her radiant face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe they worked there,&rdquo; Lloyd replied,
shaking loose the reins and speeding the horses, that he might not be
overtaken. In a few minutes they reached the factory neighborhood.
There were three factories: two of them on opposite sides of the
road, humming with labor, and puffing with jets of steam at different
points; Lloyd's, beyond, was as large as both those standing hushed
with windows blank in the afternoon sunshine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose the poor men feel pretty badly at being thrown
out of work,&rdquo; Mrs. Lloyd said, looking up at the windows as she
slipped past in her nest of furs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They feel so badly that I have seen a round dozen since we
started out taking advantage of their liberty to have a sleigh-ride
with livery teams at a good round price,&rdquo; Lloyd replied, with
languid emphasis. He never spoke with any force of argument to his
wife, nor indeed to any one else, in justification of his actions.
His reasons for action were in most cases self-evolved and entirely
self-regulated. He had said not a word to any one, not even to his
foreman, of his purpose to close the factory until it was quite
fixed; he had asked no advice, explained to no one the course of
reasoning which led to his doing so. Rowe was a city of strikes, but
there had never been a strike at Lloyd's because he had abandoned the
situation in every case before the clouds of rebellion were near
enough for the storm to break. When Briggs and McGuire, the rival
manufacturers at his right and left, had resorted to cut prices when
business was dull, as a refuge from closing up, Lloyd closed with no
attempt at compromise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they need a little recreation,&rdquo; Mrs. Lloyd
observed, thinking of the little girl's face peeping out between her
mother and grandmother in the sleigh they had just passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their little recreation is on about the same scale for them
as my hiring a special railroad train every day in the week to go to
Boston would be for me,&rdquo; returned Lloyd, setting his handsome
face ahead at the track.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem dreadful foolish,&rdquo; said his wife,
&ldquo;when they are out of work, and maybe won't earn any more money
to support their families all winter&mdash;&rdquo;  Mrs. Lloyd
hesitated a minute. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if they
feel sort of desperate, and think they won't have enough for their
families, anyway&mdash;that is, enough to feed them, and they might
as well get a little good time out of it to remember by-and-by when
there ain't enough bread-and-butter. I dunno but we might do
something like that, if we were in their places&mdash;don't you,
Norman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; replied Lloyd; &ldquo;and that is the
reason why you and I are not in their places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd put her sealskin muff before her face as they turned a
windy corner, and reflected that her husband was much wiser than she,
and that the world couldn't be regulated by women's hearts, pleasant
as it would be for the world and the women, since the final outcome
would doubtless be destruction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman Lloyd was an eminent survival of the purest and
oldest-fashioned femininity, a very woman of St. Paul, except that
she did not keep silence in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Just after they had turned the corner they passed an outlying
grocery store much frequented as a lounging-place by idle men. There
was a row of them on the wooden platform (backed against the wall),
cold as it was, watching the sleighs pass, and two or three knots
gathered together for the purposes of confabulation. Nearly all of
them were employ&eacute;s of Lloyd's, and they had met at that
unseasonable hour on that bitter day, drifting together unconsciously
as towards a common nucleus of trouble, to talk over the
situation.</p>

<p>When these men, huddled up in their shabby great-coats, with caps
pulled over shaggy brows and sullenly flashing eyes, saw the Lloyds
approaching, the rumble of conversation suddenly ceased. They all
stood staring when their employer passed. Only one man, Nahum Beals,
looked fairly at Lloyd's face with a denouncing flash of eyes.</p>

<p>To this man Lloyd, recognizing him and some of the others as his
employ&eacute;s, bowed. Nahum Beals stood glaring at him in accusing
silence, and his head was as immovable as if carved in stone. The
other men, with their averted eyes, made a curious, motionless
tableau of futile and dumb resistance to power which might have been
carved with truth on the face of the rock from the beginning of the
earth.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XI</h3>

<p>The closing of Lloyd's marked, in some inscrutable way, the close
of the first period of Ellen Brewster's childhood. Looking back in
later years, she always felt her retrospective thought strike a
barrier there, beyond which her images of the past were confused. Yet
it was difficult to tell why it was so, for after the first the child
could, it seemed, have realized no difference in her life. Now and
then she heard some of that conversation characterized at once by the
confidence of wrong and injustice, and the logical doubt of it, by
solid reasoning which, if followed far enough, refuted itself, by
keen and unanswerable argument, and the wildest and most futile
enthusiasm. But she had gained nothing except the conviction of the
great wrongs of the poor of this earth and the awful tyranny of the
rich, of the everlasting moaning of Lazarus at the gates and the cry
for water later on from the depths of the rich man's hell. Somehow
that last never comforted Ellen; she had no conception of the joy of
the injured party over righteous retribution. She pitied the rich man
and Lazarus impartially, yet all the time a spirit of fierce
partisanship with these poor men was strengthening with her growth,
their eloquence over their wrongs stirred her soul, and set her feet
outside her childhood. Still, as before said, there was no tangible
difference in her daily life. The little petted treasure of the
Brewsters had all her small luxuries, sweets, and cushions of life,
as well after as before the closing of Lloyd's. And the preparations
for her aunt's wedding went on also. The sight of her lover
sleigh-riding with her rival that afternoon had been too much for the
resolution of Eva Loud's undisciplined nature. She had herself gone
to Jim Tenny's house that evening, and called him to account, to
learn that he had seriously taken her resolution not to marry at
present to proceed from a fear that he would not provide properly for
her, and that he had in this state of indignation been easily led by
the sight of Aggie Bemis's pretty face in her front door, as he drove
by, to stop. She had told Jim that she would marry him as she had
agreed if he looked at matters in that way, and had passed Aggie
Bemis's window leaning on Jim's arm with a side stare of triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be you goin' to get married next month after what you said
this mornin'?&rdquo; her sister asked, half joyfully, half
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I be,&rdquo; was all Eva replied, and Fanny stared at
her; she was so purely normal in her inconsistency as to seem almost
the other thing.</p>

<p>The preparations for the wedding went on, but Eva never seemed as
happy as she had done before the closing of Lloyd's. Jim Tenny could
get no more work, and neither could Andrew.</p>

<p>Fanny lamented that the shop had closed at that time of year, for
she had planned a Christmas tree of unprecedented splendor for Ellen,
but Mrs. Zelotes was to be depended upon as usual, and Andrew told
his wife to make no difference. &ldquo;That little thing ain't goin'
to be cheated nohow,&rdquo; he said one night after Ellen had gone to
bed and his visiting companions of the cutting-room had happened
in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know my children won't get much,&rdquo; Joseph Atkins
said, coughing as he spoke; &ldquo;they wouldn't if Lloyd's hadn't
shut down. I never see the time when I could afford to make any
account of Christmas, much as ever I could manage a turkey
Thanksgiving day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor that the Lord died for can't afford to keep his
birthday; it is the rich that he's going to cast into outer darkness,
that keep it for their own ends, and it's a blasphemy and a
mockery,&rdquo; proclaimed Nahum Beals. He was very excited that
night, and would often spring to his feet and stride across the room.
There was another man there that night, a cousin of Joseph Atkins,
John Sargent by name. He had recently moved to Rowe, since he had
obtained work at McGuire's, &ldquo;had accepted a position in the
finishing-room of Mr. H. S. McGuire's factory in the city of
Rowe,&rdquo; as the item in the local paper put it. He was a young
man, younger than his cousin, but he looked older. He had a handsome
face, under the most complete control as to its muscles. When he
laughed he gave the impression of the fixedness of merriment of a
mask. He looked keenly at Nahum Beals with that immovable laugh on
his face, and spoke with perfectly good-natured sarcasm. &ldquo;All
very well for the string-pieces of the bridge from oppression to
freedom,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you need some common-sense for
the ties, or you'll slump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain't in the Old Testament, but the nineteenth century,
and those old prophets, if they were alive to-day, would have to step
down out of their flaming chariots and hang their mantles on the
bushes, and instead of standing on mountain-tops and tellin' their
enemies what rats they were, and how they would get what they
deserved later on, they would have to tell their enemies what they
wanted them to do to better matters, and make them do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instead of standing by your own strike in Greenboro, you
quit and come here to work in McGuire's the minute you got a
chance,&rdquo; said Nahum Beals, sullenly, and Sargent responded,
with his unrelaxing laugh, &ldquo;I left enough strikers for the
situation in Greenboro; don't you worry about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he done quite right to quit the strike if he got a
chance to work,&rdquo; Joseph Atkins interposed. &ldquo;Folks have
got to look out for themselves, labor reform or no labor
reform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's the corner-stone of labor reform, seems to
me,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me sometimes you talk like a damned scab,&rdquo;
cried Nahum Beals, fiercely, red spots flickering in his thin cheeks.
Andrew looked at him, and spoke with slow wrath. &ldquo;Look here,
Nahum Beals,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you're in my house, but I ain't
goin' to stand no such talk as that, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Sargent laid a pacifically detaining hand on Nahum Beals's
arm as he strode past him. &ldquo;Oh, Lord, stop rampagin' up and
down like a wildcat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What good do you think
you're doin' tearin' and shoutin' and insultin' people? He ain't
talkin' like a scab, he's only talkin' a tie to your
string-piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Joseph Atkins. Sargent boarded with
him, and the board money was a godsend to him, now he was out of
work. John Sargent had fixed his own price, and it was an unheard-of
one for such simple fare as he had. His weekly dollars kept the whole
poor family in food. But John Sargent was a bachelor, and earning
remarkably good wages, and Joseph Atkins's ailing wife, whom illness
and privation had made unnaturally grasping and ungrateful, told her
cronies that it wasn't as if he couldn't afford it.</p>

<p>Up-stairs little Ellen lay in her bed, her doll in her arms,
listening to the low rumble of masculine voices in the room below.
Her mother had gone out, and there were only the men there. They were
smoking, and the odor of their pipes floated up into Ellen's chamber
through the door-cracks. She thought how her grandmother Brewster
would sniff when she came in next day. She could hear her saying,
&ldquo;Well, for my part, if those men couldn't smoke their old pipes
somewhere else besides in my sittin'-room, I wouldn't have 'em in the
house.&rdquo;  But that reflection did not trouble Ellen very long,
and she had never been disturbed herself by the odor of the pipes.
She thought of them insensibly as the usual atmosphere when men were
gathered together in any place except the church. She knew that they
were talking about that old trouble, and Nahum Beals's voice of high
wrath made her shrink; but, after all, she was removed from it all
that night into a little prospective paradise of her own, which, as
is the case in childhood, seemed to overgild her own future and all
the troubles of the world. Christmas was only a week distant, she was
to have a tree, and the very next evening her mother had promised to
take her down-town and show her the beautiful, lighted Christmas
shops. She wondered, listening to that rumble of discontent below,
why grown-up men and women ever fretted when they were at liberty to
go down-town every evening when they chose and look at the lighted
shops, for she could still picture pure delight for others without
envy or bitterness.</p>

<p>The next day the child was radiant; she danced rather than walked;
she could not speak without a smile; she could eat nothing, for her
happiness was so purely spiritual that desires of the flesh were in
abeyance. Her heart beat fast; the constantly recurring memory of
what was about to happen fairly overwhelmed her as with waves of
delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don't eat your supper you can't go, and that's all
there is about it,&rdquo; her mother told her when they were seated
at the table, and Ellen sat dreaming before her toast and peach
preserve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must eat your supper, Ellen,&rdquo; Andrew said,
anxiously. Andrew had on his other coat, and he had shaved, and was
going too, as was Mrs. Zelotes Brewster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She 'ain't eat a thing all day, she's so excited about
goin',&rdquo; Fanny said. &ldquo;Now, Ellen, you must eat your
supper, or you can't go&mdash;you'll be sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Ellen ate her supper, though exceeding joy as well as
exceeding woe can make food lose its savor, and toast and preserves
were as ashes on her tongue when the very fragrance of coming
happiness was in her soul.</p>

<p>When, finally, in hand of her mother, while Andrew walked behind
with her grandmother, she went towards the lights of the town, she
had a feeling as of wings on her feet. However, she walked soberly
enough with wide eyes of amazement and delight at
everything&mdash;the long, silver track of the snowy road under the
light of the full moon, the slants of the house roofs sparkling with
crusts of crystals, the lighted windows set with house plants, for
the dwellers in the outskirts of Rowe loved house plants, and their
front windows bloomed with the emulative splendor of geraniums from
fall to spring. She saw behind them glimpses of lives and some doings
as real as her own, but mysterious under the locks of other
personalities, and therefore as full of possibilities of preciousness
as the sheet of morning dew over a neighbor's yard; she had often
believed she saw diamonds sparkle in that, though never in her own.
She had proved it otherwise too often. So Ellen, seeing through a
window a little girl of her own age in a red frock, straightway
believed it to be satin of the richest quality, and, seeing through
another window a tea-table spread, had no doubt that the tin teapot
was silver. A girl with a crown of yellow braids pulled down a
curtain, and she thought her as beautiful as an angel; but of all
this she said nothing at all, only walked soberly on, holding fast to
her mother's hand.</p>

<p>When they were half-way to the shops, a door of a white house
close to the road flew open and shut again with a bang, there was a
scurry and grating slide on the front walk, then the gate was thrown
back, and a boy dashed through with a wild whoop, just escaping
contact with Mrs. Zelotes Brewster. &ldquo;You'd better be
careful,&rdquo; said she, sharply. &ldquo;It ain't the thing for boys
to come tearin' out of yards in the evenin' without seein' where they
are goin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy cast an abashed glance at her. The street-lamp shone full
on his face, which was round and reddened by the frosty winds, with
an aimlessly grinning mouth of uncertain youth, and black eyes with a
bold and cheerful outlook on the unknown. He was only ten, but he was
large for his age. Ellen, when he looked from her grandmother back at
her, thought him almost a man, and then she saw that he was the boy
who had brought the chestnuts to her the night when she had returned
from her runaway excursion. The boy recognized her at the same
moment, and his mouth seemed to gape wider, and a moist red
overspread his face down to his swathing woollen scarf. Then he gave
another whoop significant of the extreme of nervous abashedness and
the incipient defiance of his masculine estate, there was a flourish
of heels, followed by a swift glimmering slide of steel, and he was
off trailing his sled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's that Joy boy that brought Ellen the chestnuts that
time,&rdquo; Fanny said. &ldquo;Do you remember him,
Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; replied Ellen. The look of the boy in
her face had bewildered and confused her, without her knowing the why
of it. It was as if she had spelled a word in her reading-book whose
meaning she could not grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care who he is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, &ldquo;he
'ain't no business racin' out of gates that way, and his folks hadn't
ought to let a boy no older than that out alone of nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They kept on, and the boy apparently left them far behind in his
career of youthful exuberance, until they came to the factories.
Andrew looked up at the windows of Lloyd's, dark except for a faint
glimmer in a basement window from the lamp of the solitary watchman,
and drew a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't as bad for you as it is for some,&rdquo; his
mother said, sharply, and then she jumped aside, catching her son's
arm as the boy sprang out of a covering shadow under the wall of
Lloyd's and dashed before them with another wild whoop and another
glance of defiant bashfulness at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My land! it's that boy again,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Zelotes.
&ldquo;Here, you boy!&mdash;boy! What's your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is Granville Joy,&rdquo; Ellen replied,
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how did you know, child?&rdquo; her grandmother asked.
&ldquo;Seems to me he's got a highfalutin' name enough. Here you,
Granville&mdash;if that's your name&mdash;don't you know any better
than to&mdash;&rdquo;  But the boy was gone, his sled creaking on the
hard snow at his heels, and a faint whoop sounded from the
distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess if I had the bringin' up of that boy there wouldn't
be such doin's,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, severely. &ldquo;His
mother's a pretty woman, but I don't believe she's got much force.
She wouldn't have given him such a name if she had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She named him after the town she came from,&rdquo; said
Fanny. &ldquo;She told me once. She's a real smart woman, and she
makes that boy stand around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must; it looks as if he was standin' round pretty
lively jest now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes. &ldquo;Namin' of a boy
after a town! They'd better wait and name a town after the boy if he
amounts to anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mother told me he was goin' into the first
grammar-school next year,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pity the teacher,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, and then she
recoiled, for the boy made another dart from behind a lamp-post,
crossed their path, and was off again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My land!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Zelotes, &ldquo;you speak to
him, Andrew.&rdquo;  But Andrew laughed. &ldquo;Might as well speak
to a whirlwind,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He ain't doin' any harm,
mother; it's only his boyish antics. For Heaven's sake, let him enjoy
himself while he can, it won't be long before the grind-mill in there
will get hold of him, and then he'll be sober enough to suit
anybody,&rdquo; and Andrew pointed at Lloyd's as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys can be boys,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, severely,
&ldquo;and they can have a good time, but they can behave
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of them looking after that flying and whooping figure ahead
had the slightest idea of the true situation. They did not know that
the boy was confused by the fires, none the less ardent that they
were so innocent, of a first love for Ellen; that, ever since he had
seen her little, fair face on her aunt's shoulder the day when she
was found, it had been even closer to his heart than his sled and his
jackstones and his ball, and his hope of pudding for dinner. They did
not know that he had toiled at the wood-pile of a Saturday, and run
errands after school, to earn money to buy Christmas presents for his
mother and Ellen; that he had at that very minute in his purse in the
bottom of his pocket the sum of eighty-nine cents, mostly in coppers,
since his wage was generally payable in that coin, and his pocket
sagged arduously therefrom. They did not know that he was even then
bound upon an errand to the grocery store for a bag of flour to be
brought home on his sled, and would thereby swell his exchequer by
another cent. They did not know what dawning chords of love, and
knowledge of love, that wild whoop expressed; and the boy dodged and
darted and hid, and appeared before them all the way to the busy main
street of Rowe; and, after they had entered the great store where the
finest Christmas display was held, he stood before the window staring
at Ellen vanishing in a brilliant vista, and whooped now and then,
regardless of public opinion.</p>

<p>Ellen, when once she was inside the store, forgot everything else.
She clung more tightly to her mother's hand, as one will cling to any
wonted stay of love in the midst of strangeness, even of joy, and she
saw everything with eyes which photographed it upon her very soul. At
first she had an impression of a dazzling incoherence of splendor, of
a blare as of thousands of musical instruments all sounding different
notes of delight, of a weaving pattern of colors, too intricate to
master, of a mingled odor of paint and varnish, and pine and hemlock
boughs, and then she spelled out the letters of the details. She
looked at those counters set with the miniature paraphernalia of
household life which give the first sweet taste of domesticity and
housekeeping joys to a little girl.</p>

<p>There were the sets of dolls' furniture, and the dolls, dishes,
and there was a counter with dolls' cooking-stoves and ranges
bristling with the most delightful realism of pots and pans, at which
she gazed so fixedly and breathlessly that she looked almost stupid.
Her elders watched half in delight, half with pain, that they could
not purchase everything at which she looked. Mrs. Zelotes bought some
things surreptitiously, hiding the parcels under her shawl. Andrew,
whispering to a salesman, asked the price of a great cooking-stove at
which Ellen looked long. When he heard the amount he sighed. Fanny
touched his arm comfortingly. &ldquo;There would be no sense in your
buying that, if you had all the money in creation,&rdquo; she said,
in a hushed voice. &ldquo;There's a twenty-five-cent one that's good
enough. I'm going to buy that for her to-morrow. She'll never know
the difference.&rdquo;  But Andrew Brewster, nevertheless, went
through the great, dazzling shop with his heart full of bitterness.
It seemed to him monstrous and incredible that he had a child as
beautiful and altogether wonderful as that, and could not buy the
whole stock for her if she wanted it. He had never in his whole life
wanted anything for himself that he could not have, enough to give
him pain, but he wanted for his child with a longing that was a
passion. Her little desires seemed to him the most important and
sacred needs in the whole world. He watched her with pity and
admiration, and shame at his own impotence of love to give her
all.</p>

<p>But Ellen knew nothing of it. She was radiant. She never thought
of wanting all those treasures further than she already had them. She
gazed at the wonders in that department where the toy animals were
kept, and which resembled a miniature menagerie, the silence broken
by the mooing of cows, the braying of donkeys, the whistle of
canaries, and the roars of mock-lions when their powers were invoked
by the attendants, and her ears drank in that discordant bable of
tiny mimicry like music. There was no spirit of criticism in her. She
was utterly pleased with everything.</p>

<p>When her grandmother held up a toy-horse and said the fore-legs
were too long, Ellen wondered what she meant. To her mind it was more
like a horse than any real one she had ever seen.</p>

<p>As she gazed at the decorations, the wreaths, the gauze, the
tinsel, and paper angels, suspended by invisible wires over the
counters, and all glittering and shining and twinkling with light, a
strong whiff of evergreen fragrance came to her, and the aroma of
fir-balsam, and it was to her the very breath of all the mysterious
joy and hitherto untasted festivity of this earth into which she had
come. She felt deep in her childish soul the sense of a promise of
happiness in the future, of which this was a foretaste. When she went
into the department where the dolls dwelt, she fairly turned pale.
They swung, and sat, and lay, and stood, as in angelic ranks, all
smiling between shining fluffs of hair. It was a chorus of smiles,
and made the child's heart fairly leap. She felt as if all the dolls
were smiling at her. She clung fast to her mother's hand, and hid her
face against her skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what is the matter, Ellen?&rdquo; Fanny asked. Ellen
looked up, and smiled timidly and confusedly, then at the dazzle of
waxen faces and golden locks above skirts of delicate pink and blue
and white, like flower petals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never saw so many dolls together before, did you,
Ellen?&rdquo; said Andrew; then he added, wistfully, &ldquo;There
ain't one of 'em any bigger and prettier than your own doll, be they,
Ellen?&rdquo;  And that, although he had never recovered from his
uneasiness about that mysterious doll.</p>

<p>Ellen had not seen Cynthia Lennox since that morning several weeks
ago when she had run away from her, except one glimpse when she was
sleigh-riding. Now all at once, when they had stopped to look at some
wonderful doll-houses, she saw her face to face. Ellen had been
gazing with rapture at a great doll-house completely furnished, and
Andrew had made one of his miserable side inquiries as to its price,
and Fanny had said, quite loud, &ldquo;Lord, Andrew, you might just
as well ask the price of the store! You know such a thing as that is
out of the question for any child unless her father is rich as Norman
Lloyd,&rdquo; and Ellen, who had not noticed what they were saying,
looked up, when a faint breath of violets smote her sense with a
quick memory, and there was the strange lady who had taken her into
her house and kept her and given her the doll, the strange lady whom
the gentleman said might be punished for keeping her if people were
to know.</p>

<p>Cynthia Lennox went pale when, without knowing what was going to
happen, she looked down and saw suddenly the child's innocent face
looking into hers. She stood wavering in her trailing, fur-lined, and
softly whispering draperies, so marked and set aside by her grace and
elegance and countenance of superiority and proud calm that people
turned to look after her more than after many a young beauty, and did
not, for a second, know what to say or do. She had no mind to shrink
from a recognition of the child; she had no fear of the result, but
there was a distinct shrinking at a scene with that flashing-eyed and
heavy-browed mother of the child in such a place as that. She would
undoubtedly speak very loud. She expected the volley of recrimination
in a high treble which would follow the announcement in that sweet
little flute which she remembered so well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, that is the lady who kept me, and would not let me
go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen, after a second's innocent and startled regard, turned
away with no more recognition than if she had been a stranger. She
turned her little back to her, and looked at the doll-house. A great
flush flamed over Cynthia Lennox's face, and a qualm of mortal shame.
She took an impetuous glide forward, and was just about to speak and
tell the truth, whatever the consequences, and not be outdone in
magnanimity by that child, when a young girl with a sickly but
impudent and pretty face jostled her rudely. The utter pertness of
her ignorant youth knew no respect for even the rich Miss Cynthia
Lennox. &ldquo;Here's your parcel, lady,&rdquo; she said, in her
rough young voice, its shrillness modified by hoarseness from too
much shouting for cash boys during this busy season, and she thrust,
with her absent eyes upon a gentleman coming towards her, a parcel
into Cynthia's hands. Somehow the touch of that parcel seemed to
bring Cynthia to her senses. It was a kodak which she had been
purchasing for the little boy who had lived with her, and whom it had
almost broken her heart to lose. She remembered what her friend Lyman
Risley had said, that it might make trouble for others besides
herself. She took her parcel with that involuntary meekness which the
proudest learn before the matchless audacity of youthful ignorance
when it fairly asserts itself, and passed out of the store to her
waiting carriage. Ellen saw her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was Cynthia Lennox, wasn't it?&rdquo; Fanny said, with
something like awe. &ldquo;Wasn't that an elegant cloak she had on? I
guess it was Russian sable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care if it was, it ain't a mite handsomer than my
cape lined with squirrel,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes.</p>

<p>Ellen looked intently at a game on the counter. It was ten o'clock
when Ellen went home. She had been into all the principal stores
which were decorated for Christmas. Her brain resembled a
kaleidoscope as she hurried along at her mother's hand. Every thought
seemed to whirl the disk, and new and more dazzling combinations
appeared, but the principle which underlay the whole was that of the
mystery of festivity and joy upon the face of the earth, of which
this Christmas wealth was the key.</p>

<p>The Brewsters had scarcely reached the factory neighborhood when
there was a swift bound ahead of them and the familiar whoop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's that boy again,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes.</p>

<p>She made various remonstrances, and even Andrew, when the boy had
passed his own home in his persistent dogging of them, called out to
him, as did Fanny, but he was too far ahead to hear. The boy followed
them quite to their gate, proceeding with wild spurts and dashes from
shadow to shadow, and at last reappeared from behind one of the
evergreen trees in the west yard, springing out of its long shadow
with strange effect. He darted close to Ellen as she passed in the
gate, crammed something into her hand, and was gone. Andrew could not
catch him, though he ran after him. &ldquo;He ran like a
rabbit,&rdquo; he said, coming breathlessly into the house, where
they were looking at the treasure the boy had thrust upon Ellen. It
was a marvel of a patent top, which the boy had long desired to own.
He had spent all his money on it, and his mother was cheated of her
Christmas present, but he had given, and Ellen had received, her
first token of love.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XII</h3>

<p>The next spring Ellen went to school. When a child who has reigned
in undisputed sovereignty at home is thrust among other children at
school, one of two things happens: either she is scorned and rebelled
against, and her little crown of superiority rolled in the dust of
the common playground, or she extends the territories of her empire.
Ellen extended hers, though involuntarily, for there was no conscious
thirst for power in her.</p>

<p>On her first morning at school, she seated herself at her desk and
looked forth from the golden cloud of her curls, her eyes full of
innocent contemplation, her mouth corners gravely drooping. She knew
one little girl who sat not far from her. The little girl's name was
Floretta Vining. Floretta was built on the scale of a fairy, with
tiny, fine, waxen features, a little tossing mane of flaxen hair,
eyes a most lovely and perfect blue, with no more depth in them than
in the blue of china, and an expression of the sweetest and most
innocent inanity and irresponsibility. Nobody ever expected anything
of this little Floretta Vining. She was always a negative success.
She smiled around from the foot of her curving class, and never had
her lessons, but she never disobeyed the rules, except that of
punctuality.</p>

<p>Floretta was late at school. She came daintily up the aisle, two
cheap bangles on one wrist slipping over a slim hand, and tinkling.
Floretta's mother had a taste for the cheaply decorative. There was
an abundance of coarse lace on Floretta's frock, and she wore a
superfluous sash which was not too fresh. Floretta toed out
excessively, her slender little feet pointing out sharply, almost at
right angles with each other, and Ellen admired her for that. She
watched her coming, planting each foot as carefully and precisely as
a bird, her lace frills flouncing up and down, her bangles jingling,
and thought how very pretty she was.</p>

<p>Ellen felt herself very loving towards the teacher and Floretta
Vining. Floretta leaned forward as soon as she was seated and gazed
at her with astonishment, and that deepening of amiability and
general sweetness which one can imagine in the face of a doll after
persistent scrutiny. Ellen smiled decorously, for she was not sure
how much smiling was permissible in school. When she smiled guardedly
at Floretta, she was conscious of another face regarding her, twisted
slightly over a shabby little shoulder covered with an ignominious
blue stuff, spotted and faded. This little girl's wisp of brown braid
was tied with a shoe-string, and she looked poorer than any other
child in the school, but she had an honest light in her eyes, and
Ellen considered her to be rather more beautiful than Floretta.</p>

<p>She was Maria Atkins, Joseph Atkins's second child. Ellen sat with
her book before her, and the strange, new atmosphere of the
school-room stole over her senses. It was not altogether pleasant,
although it was considered that the ventilation was after the most
approved modern system. She perceived a strong odor of peppermints,
and Floretta Vining was waving ostentatiously a coarse little
pocket-handkerchief scented with New-mown Hay. There was also a
strong effusion of stale dinners and storm-beaten woollen garments,
but there was, after all, that savor of festivity which Ellen was apt
to discover in the new. She looked over her book with utter content.
In a line with her, on the boys' side, there appeared a covertly
peeping face under a thatch of light hair, and Ellen, influenced
insensibly by the boy's shyly worshipful eyes, looked and saw
Granville Joy. She remembered the Christmas top, and blushed very
pink without knowing why, and flirted all her curls towards the boys'
side.</p>

<p>Ellen, from having so little acquaintance with boys, had had no
very well-defined sentiments towards them, but now, on being set
apart with her feminine element, and separated so definitely by the
middle aisle of the school-room, she began to experience sensations
both of shyness and exclusiveness. She did not think the boys, in
their coarse clothes, with their cropped heads, half as pretty as the
girls.</p>

<p>The teacher coming down the aisle laid a caressing hand on Ellen's
curls, and the child looked up at her with that confidence which is
exquisite flattery.</p>

<p>After she had passed, Ellen heard a subtle whisper somewhere at
her back; it was half audible, but its meaning was entirely plain. It
signified utmost scorn and satirical contempt. It was fine-pointed
and far-reaching. A number looked around. It was as expressive as a
whole sentence, and, being as concentrated, was fairly explosive with
meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H'm, ain't you pretty? Ain't you dreadful pretty, little
dolly-pinky-rosy. H'm, teacher's partial. Ain't you pretty? Ain't you
stuck up? H'm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen, not being used to the school vernacular, did not fairly
apprehend all this, and least of all that it was directed towards
herself. She cast a startled look around, then turned to her book.
She leaned back in her seat and held her book before her face with
both hands, and began to read, spelling out the words noiselessly.
All at once, she felt a fine prick on her head, and threw back one
hand and turned quickly. The little girl behind was engrossed in
study, and all Ellen could see was the parting in her thick black
hair, for her head was supported by her two hands, her elbows were
resting on her desk, and she was whispering the boundaries of the
State of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Ellen turned back to her reading-book, and recommenced studying
with the painful faithfulness of the new student; then came again
that small, fine, exasperating prick, and she thrust her face around
quickly to see that same faithfully intent little girl.</p>

<p>Ellen rubbed her head doubtfully, and tried to fix her attention
again upon her book, but presently it came again; a prick so small
and fine that it strained consciousness; an infinitesimal point of
torture, and this time Ellen, turning with a swift flirt of her head,
caught the culprit. It was that faithful little girl, who held a
black-headed belt-pin in her hand; she had been carefully separating
one hair at a time from Ellen's golden curls, and tweaking it
out.</p>

<p>Ellen looked at her with a singular expression compounded of
bewilderment, of injury, of resentment, of alarm, and of a readiness
to accept it all as a somewhat peculiar advance towards
good-fellowship and a merry understanding. But the expression on that
dark, somewhat grimy little face, looking out at her from a jungle of
coarse, black locks, was fairly impish, almost malicious. There was
not merriment in it so much as jibing; instead of that soft regard
and worshipful admiration which Ellen was accustomed to find in new
eyes, there was resentful envy.</p>

<p>Then Ellen shrank, and bristled with defiance at the same time,
for she had the spirit of both the Brewsters and the Louds in her, in
spite of her delicacy of organization. She was a fine instrument,
capable of chords of tragedy as well as angelic strains. She saw that
the little girl who was treating her so was dressed very poorly, that
her dress was not only shabby, but actually dirty; that she, as well
as the other girl whom she noticed, had her braid tied with an old
shoe-string, and that a curious smell of leather pervaded her. Ellen
continued to regard the little girl, then suddenly she felt a hand on
her shoulder, and the teacher, Miss Rebecca Mitchell, was looking
down at her. &ldquo;What is the trouble?&rdquo; asked Miss Mitchell.
That look of half-wondering admiration to which Ellen was accustomed
was in the teacher's eyes, and Ellen again thought her beautiful.</p>

<p>One of the first, though a scarcely acknowledged principle of
beauty, is that of reflection of the fairness of the observer. Ellen
being as innocently self-seeking for love and admiration as any young
thing for its natural sustenance, was quick to recognize it, though
she did not understand that what she saw was herself in the teacher's
eyes, and not the teacher. She gazed up in that roseate face with the
wide mouth set in an inverted bow of smile, curtained, as it were,
with smoothly crinkled auburn hair clearly outlined against the
cheeks, at the palpitating curve of shiny black-silk bosom, adorned
with a festoon of heavy gold watch-chain, and thought that here was
love, and beauty, and richness, and elegance, and great wisdom,
calling for reverence but no fear. She answered not one word to the
teacher's question, but continued to gaze at her with that look of
wide-eyed and contemplative regard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Ellen?&rdquo; repeated Miss Mitchell.
&ldquo;Why were you looking around so?&rdquo;  Ellen said nothing.
The little girl behind had her head bent over her book so low that
the sulky curves of her mouth did not show. The teacher turned to
her&mdash;&ldquo;Abby Atkins,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what were you
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby Atkins did not raise her studious head. She did not seem to
hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abby Atkins,&rdquo; said the teacher, sharply,
&ldquo;answer me. What were you doing?&rdquo;  Then the little girl
answered, with a sulky note, half growl, half whimper, like some
helpless but indomitable little trapped animal,
&ldquo;Nothin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; said the teacher, and her voice changed
indescribably. &ldquo;What was she doing?&rdquo;  Ellen did not
answer. She looked up in the teacher's face, then cast down her eyes
and sat there, her little hands folded in tightly clinched fists in
her lap, her mouth a pink line of resistance. &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo;
repeated the teacher, and she tried to make her voice sharp, but in
spite of herself it was caressing. Her heart had gone out to the
child the moment she had seen her enter the school-room. She was as
helpless before her as before a lover. She was wild to catch her up
and caress her instead of pestering her with questions. &ldquo;Ellen,
you must answer me,&rdquo; she said, but Ellen sat still.</p>

<p>Half the scholars were on their feet, reaching and craning their
necks. The teacher turned on them, and there was no lack of sharpness
in her tone. &ldquo;Sit down this moment, every one of you,&rdquo;
she called. &ldquo;Abby Atkins, if there is any more disturbance, I
shall know what is at the root of the matter. If I see you turning
around again, Ellen, I shall insist upon knowing why.&rdquo;  Then
the teacher placed a caressing hand upon Ellen's yellow head, and
passed down the aisle to her desk.</p>

<p>Ellen had no more trouble during the session. Abby Atkins was
commendably quiet and studious, and when called out to recitation
made the best one in her class. She was really brilliant in a
defiant, reluctant fashion. However, though she did not again disturb
Ellen's curls, she glowered at her with furtive but unrelaxed
hostility over her book. Especially a blue ribbon which confined
Ellen's curls in a beautiful bow fired her eyes of animosity. She
looked hard at it, then she pulled her black braid over her shoulder
and felt of the hard shoe-string knot, and frowned with an ugly frown
of envy and bitterest injury, and asked herself the world-wide and
world-old question as to the why of inequality, and, though it was
based on such trivialities as blue ribbons and shoe-strings, it was
none the less vital to her mind. She would have loved, have gloried,
to pull off that blue ribbon, put it on her own black braid, and tie
up those yellow curls with her own shoe-string with a vicious yank of
security. But all the time it was not so much because she wanted the
ribbon as because she did not wish to be slighted in the distribution
of things. Abby Atkins cared no more for personal ornament than a
wild cat, but she wanted her just allotment of the booty of the
world. So at recess she watched her chance. Ellen was surrounded by
an admiring circle of big girls, gushing with affection. &ldquo;Oh,
you dear little thing,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Only look at her
beautiful curls. Give me a kiss, won't you, darling?&rdquo;  Little
reverent fingers twined Ellen's golden curls, red apples were thrust
forward for her to take bites, sticky morsels of candy were forced
secretly into her hands. Abby Atkins stood aloof. &ldquo;You mean
little thing,&rdquo; one of the big girls said suddenly, catching
hold of her thin shoulder and shaking her&mdash;&ldquo;you mean
little thing, I saw you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said another big girl, &ldquo;and I was a
good mind to tell on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you had better look out, and not plague that dear
little thing,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rdquo; chimed in still
another big girl. &ldquo;Only look how pretty she is, the little
darling&mdash;the idea of your tormenting her. You deserve a good,
hard whipping, Abby Atkins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This big girl was herself a beauty and wore a fine and precise
blue-ribbon bow, and Abby Atkins looked at her with a scowl of
hatred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's an ugly little thing,&rdquo; said the big girls among
themselves as they went edging gently and imperceptibly away towards
a knot of big boys, and then Abby Atkins's chance had come. She
advanced with a spring upon Ellen Brewster, and she pulled that blue
ribbon off her head so cruelly and fiercely that she pulled out some
of the golden hairs with it and threw it on the ground, and stamped
on it. Then she seized Ellen by the shoulders and proceeded to shake
her for wearing a blue ribbon when she herself wore a shoe-string,
but she reckoned without Ellen. One would as soon have expected to
meet fight in a little child angel as in this Ellen Brewster, but she
did not come of her ancestors for nothing.</p>

<p>Although she was so daintily built that she looked smaller, she
was in reality larger than the other girl, and as she straightened
herself in her wrath she seemed a head taller and proportionately
broad. She tossed her yellow head, and her face took on an expression
of noble courage and indignation, but she never said a word. She
simply took Abby Atkins by the arms and lifted her off her feet and
seated her on the ground. Then she picked up her blue ribbon, and
walked off, and Abby scrambled to her feet and looked after her with
a vanquished but untamed air. Nobody had seen what happened except
Abby's younger sister Maria and Granville Joy. Granville pressed
stealthily close to Ellen as she marched away and whispered, his face
blazing, his voice full of confidence and congratulation, &ldquo;Say,
if she'd been a boy, I'd licked her for you, and you wouldn't hev had
to tech her yourself;&rdquo; and Maria walked up and eyes her
prostrate but defiantly glaring sister&mdash;&ldquo;I ain't sorry one
mite, Abby Atkins,&rdquo; she declared&mdash;&ldquo;so
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go 'long,&rdquo; returned Abby, struggling to her feet,
and shaking her small skirts energetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your dress is jest as wet as if you'd set down in a puddle,
and you'll catch it when you get home,&rdquo; Maria said,
pitilessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you touch her, anyhow; she hadn't done
nothin'?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to wear shoe-strings when other folks wear
ribbons, you can,&rdquo; said Abby Atkins. She walked away,
switching, with unabated dignity in the midst of defeat, the draggled
tail of her poor little dress. She had gone down like a cat; she was
not in the least hurt except in her sense of justice; that was jarred
to a still greater lack of equilibrium. She felt as if she had been
floored by Providence in conjunction with a blue bow, and her very
soul rose in futile rebellion. But, curiously enough, her personal
ire against Ellen vanished.</p>

<p>At the afternoon recess she gave Ellen the sound half of an old
red Baldwin apple which she had brought for luncheon, and watched her
bite into it, which Ellen did readily, for she was not a child to
cherish enmity, with an odd triumph. &ldquo;The other half ain't fit
to eat, it's all wormy,&rdquo; said Abby Atkins, flinging it away as
she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to have kept this,&rdquo; Ellen cried out,
holding towards her the half, minus one little bite. But Abby Atkins
shook her head forcibly. &ldquo;That was why I gave it to you,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;Say, didn't you never have to tie up your hair with
a shoe-string?&rdquo;  Ellen shook her head, looking at her
wonderingly. Then with a sudden impulse she tore off the blue ribbon
from her curls. &ldquo;Say, you take it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my
mother won't care. I'd just as lief wear the shoe-string,
honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want your blue ribbon,&rdquo; Abby returned,
stoutly; &ldquo;a shoe-string is a good deal better to tie the hair
with. I don't want your blue ribbon; I don't want no blue ribbon
unless it's mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be yours if I give it to you,&rdquo; Ellen
declared, with blue eyes of astonishment and consternation upon this
very strange little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it wouldn't,&rdquo; maintained Abby Atkins.</p>

<p>But it ended in the two girls, with that wonderful and
inexplicable adjustment of childhood into one groove after harsh
grating on different levels, walking off together with arms around
each other's waist, and after school began Ellen often felt a soft,
cat-like pat on her head, and turned round with a loving glance at
Abby Atkins.</p>

<p>Ellen talked more about Abby Atkins than any other of the children
when she got home, and while her mother looked at it all easily, her
grandmother was doubtful. &ldquo;There's others that I should rather
have Ellen thick with,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I 'ain't nothin'
against the Atkinses, but they can't have been as well brought up as
some, they have had so little to do with, and their mother's been
ailin' so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen may as well begin as she can hold out, and be
intimate with them that will be intimate with her,&rdquo; Eva said,
rather bitterly. Eva was married by this time, and living with Jim
and his mother. She wore in those days an expression of bitterly
defiant triumph and happiness, as of one who has wrested his sweet
from fate under the ban of the law, and is determined to get the
flavor of it though the skies fall. &ldquo;I suppose I did wrong
marrying Jim,&rdquo; she often told her sister, &ldquo;but I can't
help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe Jim will get work before long,&rdquo; her sister
would say, consolingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have about given up,&rdquo; Eva would reply. &ldquo;I
guess Jim will have to roost on a flour-barrel at Munsey's store the
rest of his days; but as long as he belongs to me, it don't make so
much difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva had taken up an agency for a cosmetic which was manufactured
by a woman in Rowe. She had one window of the north parlor in the
Tenny cottage, which had been given up to her when she married Jim,
filled with the little pink boxes containing the &ldquo;Fairy
Cream,&rdquo; and a great sign, but the trade languished. Both Eva
and Jim had tried in vain to obtain employment in factories in other
towns.</p>

<p>Lloyd's had not reopened, although it was April, and Andrew was
drawing on his savings. Fanny had surreptitiously answered an
advertisement purporting to give instructions to women as to the
earning of large sums of money at home, and was engaged with a stock
of glass and paints which she hurriedly swept out of sight when any
one's shadow passed the window, and later she found herself to be the
victim of a small swindling conspiracy, and lost the dollar which she
had invested. But Ellen knew nothing of all this. She lacked none of
her accustomed necessaries nor luxuries, and with her school a new
life full of keen, new savors or relish began for her. There were
also new affections in it.</p>

<p>Ellen was as yet too young, and too confident in love, to have new
affections plunge her into anything but a delightful sort of
anti-blossom tumult. There was no suspense, no doubt, no jealousy,
only utter acquiescence of single-heartedness, admiration, and trust.
She thought Abby Atkins and Floretta Vining lovely and dependable;
she parted from them at night without a pang, and looked forward
blissfully to the meeting next morning. She also had sentiments
equally peaceful and pronounced, though instinctively more secret,
towards Granville Joy. She used to glance over towards the boys' side
and meet his side-long eyes without so much a quickening of her
pulses as a quickening of her imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know who your beau is,&rdquo; Floretta Vining, who was in
advance of her years, said to her once, and Ellen looked at her with
half-stupid wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His first name begins with a G and his last with a
J,&rdquo; Floretta tittered, and Ellen continued to look at her with
the faintest suspicion of a blush, because she had a feminine
instinct that a blush was in order, not because she knew of any
reason for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Floretta, with another exceedingly
foolish giggle. &ldquo;My, you are as red as a beet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't old enough to have a beau,&rdquo; Ellen said, her
soft cheeks becoming redder, and her baby face all in a tremor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you be,&rdquo; Floretta said, with authority,
&ldquo;because you are so pretty, and have got such pretty curls. Ben
Simonds said the other day you were the prettiest girl in
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then do you think he is my beau, too?&rdquo; asked Ellen,
innocently. But Floretta frowned, and tittered, and hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said except one,&rdquo; she faltered out, finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who was that?&rdquo; asked Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; pouted Floretta. &ldquo;Mebbe it was
me, though I don't think I'm so very pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Ben Simonds is your beau,&rdquo; said Ellen,
reflectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess he is,&rdquo; admitted Floretta.</p>

<p>That night, amid much wonder and tender ridicule, Ellen told her
mother and Aunt Eva, and her father, that Ben Simonds was Floretta's
beau, and Granville Joy was hers. But Andrew laughed doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want that little thing to get such ideas into her
head yet a while,&rdquo; he told Fanny afterwards, but she only
laughed at him, seeing nothing but the childish play of the thing;
but he, being a man, saw deeper.</p>

<p>However, Ellen's fondest new love was not for any of her little
mates, but for her school-teacher. To her the child's heart went out
in worship. All through the spring she offered her
violets&mdash;violets gathered laboriously after school in the meadow
back of her grandmother's house. She used to skip from hillock to
hillock of marsh grass with wary steps, lest she might slip and wet
her feet in the meadow ooze and incur her mother's displeasure, for
Fanny, in spite of her worship of the child, could speak with no
uncertain voice. She pulled up handfuls of the flowers, gleaming blue
in the dark-green hollows. Later she carried roses from the choice
bush in the yard, and, later, pears from her grandmother's tree. She
used to watch for Miss Mitchell at her gate and run to meet her, and
seize her hand and walk at her side, blushing with delight. Miss
Mitchell lived not far from Ellen, in a tidy white house with a
handsome smoke-tree on one side of the front walk and a willow with
upside-down branches on the other. Miss Mitchell had been born and
brought up in this house, but she had been teaching school in a
distant town ever since Ellen's day, so they had never been
acquainted before she went to school. Miss Mitchell lived alone with
her mother, who was an old friend of Mrs. Zelotes. Ellen privately
thought her rather better-looking than her own grandmother, though
her admiration was based upon wholly sentimental reasons. Old Mrs.
Mitchell might have earned more money in a museum of freaks than her
daughter in a district school. She was a mountain of rotundity, a
conjunction of palpitating spheres, but the soul that dwelt in this
painfully ponderous body was as mellow with affection and kindliness
as a ripe pear, and the voice that proceeded from her ever-smiling
lips was a hoarse and dove-like coo of love. Ellen at first started a
little aghast at this gigantic fleshliness, this general slough and
slump of outline, this insistency of repellent curves, and then the
old woman spoke and thrust out a great, soft hand, and the heart of
the child overleaped her artistic sense and her reason, and she
thought old Mrs. Mitchell beautiful. Mrs. Mitchell never failed to
regale her with a superior sort of cooky, and often with a covert
peppermint, and that although the Mitchells were not well off. The
old place was mortgaged, and Miss Mitchell had hard work to pay the
interest. Ellen had the vaguest ideas about the mortgage, and was
half inclined to think it might be a disfiguring patch in the
plastering of the sitting-room, which hung down in an unsightly
fashion with a disclosure of hairy edges, and threatened danger to
the heads underneath.</p>

<p>Often of a Saturday afternoon Ellen went to visit Miss Mitchell
and her mother, and really preferred them to friends of her own age.
Miss Mitchell had a store of superannuated paper dolls which dated
from her own childhood. Their quaint costumes, and old-fashioned
coiffures, and simpers were of overwhelming interest to Ellen. Even
at that early age she had a perception of the advantages of an
atmosphere to art, and even to the affections. Without understanding
it, she loved those obsolete paper-dolls and those women of former
generations better because they gave her breathing-scope for her
imagination. She could love Abby Atkins and Floretta Vining at one
bite, as it were, and that was the end of it, but she could sit and
ponder and dream over Miss Mitchell and her mother, and see whole
vistas of them in receding mirrors of affection.</p>

<p>As for the teacher and her mother, they simply adored the
child&mdash;as indeed everybody did. She continued at her first
school for a year, which was one of the hardest financially ever
experienced in Rowe. Norman Lloyd during all that time did not reopen
his factory, and in the autumn two others shut down. The streets were
full of the discontented ranks of impotent labor, and all the public
buildings were props for the weary shoulders of the unemployed. On
pleasant days the sunny sides of the vacant factories, especially,
furnished settings for lines of scowling faces of misery.</p>

<p>This atmosphere affected Ellen more than any one realized, since
the personal bearing of it was kept from her. She did not know that
her father was drawing upon his precious savings for daily needs, she
did not know how her aunt Eva and her uncle Jim were getting into
greater difficulties every day, but she was too sensitive not to be
aware of disturbances which were not in direct contact with herself.
She never forgot what she had overheard that night Lloyd's had shut
down; it was always like a blot upon the face of her happy
consciousness of life. She often overheard, as then, those loud,
dissenting voices of her father and his friends in the sitting-room,
after she had gone to bed; and then, too, Abby Atkins, who was not
spared any knowledge of hardship, told her a good deal. &ldquo;It's
awful the way them rich folks treat us,&rdquo; said Abby Atkins.
&ldquo;They own the shops and everything, and take all the money, and
let our folks do all the work. It's awful. But then,&rdquo; continued
Abby Atkins, comfortingly, &ldquo;your father has got money saved in
the bank, and he owns his house, so you can get along if he don't
have work. My father 'ain't got any, and he's got the old-fashioned
consumption, and he coughs, and it takes money for his medicine. Then
mother's sick a good deal too, and has to have medicine. We have to
have more medicine than most anything else, and we hardly ever have
any pie or cake, and it's all the fault of them rich folks.&rdquo;
Abby Atkins wound up with a tragic climax and a fierce roll of her
black eyes.</p>

<p>That evening Ellen went in to see her grandmother, and was
presented with some cookies, which she did not eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you eat them?&rdquo; Mrs. Zelotes asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I have them to do just what I want to with?&rdquo;
asked Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you want to do with a cooky except eat
it?&rdquo; Ellen blushed; she had a shamed-faced feeling before a
contemplated generosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do with them except eat them?&rdquo;
her grandmother asked, severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abby Atkins don't have any cookies 'cause her father's out
of work,&rdquo; said Ellen, abashedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did that Atkins girl ask you to bring her
cookies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do jest what you are a mind to with 'em,&rdquo;
Mrs. Zelotes said, abruptly.</p>

<p>Ellen never knew why her grandmother insisted upon her drinking a
little glass of very nice and very spicy cordial before she went
home, but the truth was, that Mrs. Zelotes thought the child so
angelic in this disposition to give up the cookies which she loved to
her little friend that she was straightway alarmed and thought her
too good to live.</p>

<p>The next day she told Fanny, and said to her, with her old face
stern with anxiety, that the child was lookin' real pindlin', and
Ellen had to take bitters for a month afterwards because she gave the
cookies to Abby Atkins.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XIII</h3>

<p>In all growth there is emulation and striving for precedence
between the spiritual and the physical, and this very emulation may
determine the rate of progression of the whole. Sometimes the one,
sometimes the other, may be in advance, but all the time the tendency
is towards the distant goal. Sometimes the two keep abreast, and then
there is the greatest harmony in speed. In Ellen Brewster at twelve
and fifteen the spiritual outstripped the physical, as is often the
case. Her eyes grew intense and hollow with reflection under knitting
brows, her thin shoulders stooped like those of a sage bent with
study and contemplation. She was slender to emaciation; her clothes
hung loosely over her form, which seemed as sexless as a lily-stem;
indeed, her body seemed only made for the head, which was flower-like
and charming, but almost painful in its delicacy, and with such
weight of innocent pondering upon the unknown conditions of things in
which she found herself. At times, of course, there were ebullitions
of youthful spirit, and the child was as inconsequent as a kitten. At
those times she was neither child nor woman; she was an anomalous
thing made up not so much of actualities as of instincts. She romped
with her mates as unseen and uncomprehended of herself as any young
animal, but the flame of her striving spirit made everything full of
unread meaning.</p>

<p>Ellen was accounted a most remarkable scholar. She had left Miss
Mitchell's school, and was in one of a higher grade. At fifteen she
entered the high-school and had a master.</p>

<p>Andrew was growing old fast in those days, though not so old as to
years. Though he was far from old, his hair was gray, his back bent.
He moved with a weary shuffle. The men in the shop began to eye him
furtively. &ldquo;Andrew Brewster will get fired next,&rdquo; they
said. &ldquo;The boss 'ain't no use for men with the first snap
gone.&rdquo;  Indeed, Andrew was constantly given jobs of lower
grades, which did not pay so well. Whenever the force was reduced on
account of dulness in trade, Andrew was one of the first to be laid
aside on waiting orders in the regular army of toil. On one of these
occasions, in the spring after Ellen was fifteen, his first fit of
recklessness seized him. One night, after loafing a week, he came
home with fever spots in his cheeks and a curiously bright, strained
look in his eyes. Fanny gazed sharply at him across the supper-table.
Finally she laid down her knife and fork, rested her elbows on the
table, and fixed her eyes commandingly upon him. &ldquo;Andrew
Brewster, what is the matter?&rdquo; said she. Ellen turned her
flower-like face towards her father, who took a swallow of tea
without saying a word, though he shuffled his feet uneasily.
&ldquo;Andrew, you answer me,&rdquo; repeated Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain't anything the matter,&rdquo; answered Andrew,
with a strange sullenness for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is, too. Now, Andrew Brewster, I ain't goin' to be
put off. I know you're on the shelf on account of hard times, so it
ain't that. It's something new. Now I want to know what it
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. Andrew, you ought to tell me. You know I ain't
afraid to bear anything that you have to bear, and Ellen is getting
old enough now, so she can understand, and she can't always be
spared. She'd better get a little knowledge of hardships while she
has us to help her bear 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ain't a hardship, and there ain't anything to spare,
Ellen,&rdquo; said Andrew; and he laughed with a hilarity totally
unlike him.</p>

<p>That was all Fanny could get out of him, but she was half
reassured. She told Eva that she didn't believe but he had been
buying some Christmas present that he knew was extravagant for Ellen,
and was afraid to tell her because he knew she would scold. But
Andrew had not been buying Christmas presents, but speculating in
mining stocks. He had resisted the temptation long. Year in and year
out he had heard the talk right and left in the shop, on the street,
and at the store of an evening. &ldquo;I'll give you a point,&rdquo;
he had heard one say to another during a discussion as to prices and
dividends. He had heard it all described as a short cross-cut over
the fields of hard labor to wealth and comfort, and he had kept his
face straight ahead in his narrow track of caution and hereditary
instincts until then. &ldquo;The savings bank is good enough for
me,&rdquo; he used to say; &ldquo;that's where my father kept his
money. I don't know anything about your stocks. I'd rather have a
little and have it safe.&rdquo;  The men could not reason him out of
his position, not even when Billy Monroe made fifteen hundred dollars
on a Colorado mine which had cost him fifteen cents per share, and
left the shop, and drove a fast horse in a Goddard buggy.</p>

<p>It was even reported that fifteen hundred was fifteen thousand,
but Andrew was proof against this brilliant loadstar of success,
though many of his mates followed it afar, just before the shares
dropped below par.</p>

<p>Jim Tenny went with the rest. &ldquo;Tell you what 'tis, Andrew,
old man,&rdquo; he said, clapping Andrew on the shoulder as they were
going out of the shop one night, &ldquo;you'd better go in
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The savings-bank is good enough for me,&rdquo; said Andrew,
with his gentle doggedness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can buy a trotter,&rdquo; urged Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never was much on trotters,&rdquo; replied Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't going to walk home many times more, you bet,&rdquo;
Jim said to Eva when he got home, and then he bent back her tensely
set face and kissed it. Eva was crocheting hoods for fifteen cents
apiece for a neighboring woman who was a padrone on a small scale,
having taken a large order from a dealer for which she realized
twenty cents apiece, and employed all the women in the neighborhood
to do the work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jim, gayly, &ldquo;I've bought some of that
&lsquo;Golden Hope&rsquo; mining stock. Billy Monroe has just made
fifteen thousand on it, and I'll make as much in a week or
two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, you 'ain't taken all the money out of the
bank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you worry, old girl,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;I
guess you'll find I can take care of you yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the stock went down, and Jim's little venture with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you were about right, old man,&rdquo; he said to
Andrew.</p>

<p>Andrew was rather looked up to for his superior caution and
sagacity. He was continually congratulated upon it.
&ldquo;Savings-banks are good enough for me,&rdquo; he kept
repeating. But that was four years ago, and now his turn had come;
the contagion of speculation had struck him at last. That was the way
with Lloyd's failing employ&eacute;s.</p>

<p>Andrew kept his stock certificate in a little, tin, trunk-shaped
box which had belonged to his father. It had a key and a tiny
padlock, and he had always stored in it the deed of his house, his
savings-bank book, and his insurance policy. He carried the key in
his pocket. Fanny never opened the box, or had any curiosity about
it, believing that she was acquainted with its contents; but now
when, on coming unexpectedly into the bedroom&mdash;the box was
always kept at the head of the bed&mdash;she heard a rattle of
papers, and caught Andrew locking the box with a confused air, she
began to suspect something. She began to look hard at the box, to
take it up and shake it when her husband was away. Fanny was
crocheting hoods as well as Eva. Ellen wished to learn, but her
mother would not allow that. &ldquo;You've got enough to do to study
your lessons,&rdquo; she said. Andrew watched his wife crochet with
ill-concealed impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't goin' to have you do that long,&rdquo; he
said&mdash;&ldquo;workin' at that rate for no more money. That Mrs.
William Pendergrass that lets out these hoods is as bad as any
factory boss in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she got the chance,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;and
they won't let out the work except that way; they can get it done so
much cheaper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you sha'n't have it, anyhow,&rdquo; said Andrew,
smiling mysteriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you ain't goin' to work again, be you,
Andrew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don't you talk the way poor Jim did. Eva wasn't going
to crochet any more hoods, and now Jim's out of work again. Eva told
me yesterday that she didn't know where the money was comin' from.
Jim's mother owns the place, and it ain't worth much, anyhow, and
they can't take it from her in her lifetime, even if she was willing
to let it go. Eva said she was goin' to try again for work herself in
the shop. She thought maybe there might be some kind of a job she
could get. Don't you talk like Jim did about his good-for-nothin'
mining stock. I've been glad enough that you had sense enough to keep
what little we had where 'twas safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't it most time for Ellen to be comin' home?&rdquo;
asked Andrew, to turn the conversation, as he felt somewhat guilty
and uncomfortable, though his eyes were jubilant. He had very little
doubt about the success of his venture. As it is with a man who
yields to love for the first time in his life, it was with Andrew in
his tardy subjection to the hazards of fortune. He was a much more
devoted slave than those who had long wooed her. He had always taken
nothing but the principal newspaper published in Rowe, but now he
subscribed to a Boston paper, the one which had the fullest financial
column, though Fanny exclaimed at his extravagance.</p>

<p>Along in midsummer, in the midst of Ellen's vacation, the mining
stock dropped fast a point or more a day. Andrew's heart began to
sink, though he was far from losing hope. He used to talk it over
with the men who advised him to buy, and come home fortified.</p>

<p>All he had to do was to be patient; the fall meant nothing wrong
with the mine, only the wrangle of speculators. &ldquo;It's like a
football, first on one side, and then on the other,&rdquo; said the
man, &ldquo;but the football's there all the same, and if it's that
you want, you're all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One night when Nahum Beals and Atkins and John Sargent were in,
Andrew repeated this wisdom, concealing the fact of its personal
application. He was anxious to have some confirmation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it's about so,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then John Sargent spoke up. &ldquo;No, it is not so,&rdquo; he
said&mdash;&ldquo;that is, not in many cases. There isn't any
football&mdash;that's the trouble. There's nothing but the money; a
lot of fools have paid for it when it never existed out of their
imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About so,&rdquo; said Nahum Beals. Andrew and Atkins
exchanged glances. Atkins was at once sympathizing and
triumphant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of those things appear to be doing well, and to be all
right,&rdquo; said Andrew, uneasily. &ldquo;The directors keep saying
that they are in a prosperous condition, even if the stock
drops.&rdquo;  He almost betrayed himself.</p>

<p>John Sargent laughed that curious, inflexible laugh of his.
&ldquo;Lord, I know all about that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I had some
once. First one thing and then another came up to hinder the working
of the mine and the payments of dividends. First there wasn't any
water, an unprecedented dry season in those parts, oldest inhabitants
for evidence. Then there was too much water, no way to mine except
they employed professional divers, everything under water. Then the
transportation was to pay; then, when that was remedied, the ore
didn't come out in shape to transport in the rough and had to be
worked up on the premises, and new mills had to be built and new
machinery put in, and a few little Irish dividends were collected for
that. Then when they got the mills up and the machinery in, they
struck another kind of ore that ought to be transported; then there
came a landslide and carried half the road into a ca&ntilde;on. So it
went on, one thing and another. If ever that darned mine had got into
working order, right kind of ore, water enough and not too much,
roads and machinery all right, and everything swimming, the Day of
Judgment would have come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever get anything out of it?&rdquo; inquired
Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything out of it?&rdquo; repeated the other. &ldquo;Yes,
I got enough worldly wisdom never to buy any more mining stock, after
I had paid assessments on it for two years and the whole thing went
to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may come up yet,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's nothing to come up,&rdquo; said John Sargent. He
had been away from Rowe a year, but had just returned, and was again
boarding with Atkins, and all the family lived on his board money.
Andrew and Nahum Beals were smoking pipes. Andrew gently, like a
philosopher, who smokes that he may dream; Nahum with furious jets
and frequent removals of his pipe for scowling speeches. John Sargent
did not smoke at all. He had left off cigars first, then even his
pipe. He gave the money which he saved thereby to Mrs. Atkins as a
bonus on his board money.</p>

<p>The lamp burned dimly in the blue fog of tobacco smoke, and the
windows where the curtains were not drawn were blanks of silvery
moonlight. Ellen sat on the doorstep outside and heard the talk. She
did not understand it, nor take much interest in it. Their minds were
fixed upon the way of living, and hers upon life itself. She could
bring her simplicity to bear upon the world-old question of riches
and poverty and labor, but this temporal adjunct of stocks and
markets was as yet beyond her. Her mother had gone to her aunt Eva's
and she sat alone out in the wide mystery of the summer night,
watching the lovely shift of radiance and shadows, as she might have
watched the play of a kaleidoscope, seeing the beauty of the new
combinations, and seeing without comprehending the unit which
governed them all. The night was full of cries of insistent life and
growth, of birds and insects, of calls of children, and now and then
the far-away roar of railroad trains. It was nearly midsummer. The
year was almost at its height, but had not passed it. Growth and
bloom was still in the ascendant, and had not yet attained that
maturity of perfection beyond which is the slope of death.</p>

<p>Everywhere about her were the revolutions of those unseen wheels
of nature whose immortal trend is towards the completion of time, and
whose momentum can overlap the grave; and the child was within them
and swept onward with the perfecting flowers, and the ripening fruit,
and the insects which were feeling their wings; and all
unconsciously, in a moment as it were, she unfolded a little farther
towards her own heyday of bloom. Suddenly from those heights of the
primitive and the eternal upon which a child starts and where she
still lingered she saw her future before her, shining with new
lights, and a wonderful conviction of bliss to come was over her. It
was that conviction which comes at times to all unconquered souls,
and which has the very essence of truth in it, since it overleaps the
darkness of life that lies between them and that bliss. Suddenly
Ellen felt that she was born to great happiness, and all that was to
come was towards that end. Her heart beat loud in her ears. There was
a whippoorwill calling in some trees to the left; the moon was dim
under a golden dapple of clouds. She could not feel her hands or her
feet; she seemed to feel nothing except her soul.</p>

<p>Then she heard, loud and sweet and clear, a boy's whistle, one of
the popular tunes of the day. It came nearer and nearer, and it was
in the same key with the child's thoughts and dreams. Then she saw a
slender figure dark against the moonlight stop at a fence, and she
jumped up and ran towards it with no hesitation through the dewy
grass; and it was the boy, Granville Joy. He stood looking at her. He
had a handsome, eager face, and Ellen looked at him, her lips parted,
her face like a lily in the white light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hulloo,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hulloo,&rdquo; Ellen responded, faintly.</p>

<p>Granville extended one rough, brown, boyish hand over the fence,
and Ellen laid her little, soft hand in it. He pulled her gently
close, then Ellen lifted her face, and the boy bent his, and the two
kissed each other over the fence. Then the boy went on down the
street, but he did not whistle, and Ellen went back to the doorstep,
and, looking about to be sure that none of the men in the
sitting-room saw, pulled off one little shoe and drew forth a sprig
of southernwood, or boy's-love, which was crushed under her foot.</p>

<p>That day Floretta Vining had told her that if she would put a
sprig of boy's-love in her shoe, the very first boy she met would be
the one she was going to marry; and Ellen, who was passing from one
grade of school to another, had tried it.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XIV</h3>

<p>The high-school master was a distant relative of the Lloyd's,
through whom he had obtained the position. One evening when he was
taking tea with them at Cynthia Lennox's, he spoke of Ellen. &ldquo;I
have one really remarkable scholar,&rdquo; he said, with a curious
air of self-gratulation, as if he were principally responsible for
it; &ldquo;her name is Brewster&mdash;Ellen Brewster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good land! That must be the child that ran away five or six
years ago, and all the town up in arms over it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Norman Lloyd. &ldquo;Don't you remember, Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cynthia, and continued pouring tea.
Cynthia was very little changed. In some faces time seems to engrave
lines delicately, once for all, and then lay by. She was rather more
charming now than when one had looked at her with any expectancy of
youth, since there was now no sense of disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember that,&rdquo; said Norman Lloyd. &ldquo;The child
would never tell where she had been. A curious case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the school-master, &ldquo;leaving that
childish episode out of the question, she has a really remarkable
mind. If she were a boy, I should advise a thorough education and a
profession. I should as it is, if her family were able to bear the
expense. She has that intuitive order of mind which is wonderful
enough, though not, after all, so rare in a girl; but in addition she
has the logical, which, according to my experience, is almost unknown
in a woman. She ought to have an education.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Risley, &ldquo;what is the use of
educating that unfortunate child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I say. What is the use? There she is in her sphere of
life, the daughter of a factory operative, in all probability in
after-years to be the wife of one and the mother of others. Nothing
but a rich marriage can save her, and that she is not likely to make.
Milk-maids are more likely to make rich marriages than factory girls;
there is a certain savor of romance about milk, and the dewy meadows,
and the breath of kine, but a shoe factory is brutally realistic and
illusionary. Now, why do you want to increase the poor child's
horizon farther than her little feet can carry her? Fit her to be a
good female soldier in the ranks of labor, to be a good wife and
mother to the makers of shoes, to wash and iron their uniforms of
toil, to cook well the food which affords them the requisite
nourishment to make shoes, to appreciate book-lore, which is a
pleasure and a profit to the makers of shoes; possibly in the
non-event of marriage she will make shoes herself. The system of
education in our schools is all wrong. It is both senseless and
futile. Look at the children filing past to school, and look at their
fathers, and their mothers too, filing past to the factory. Look at
their present, and look at their future. And look at the trash taught
them in their text-books&mdash;trash from its utter dissociation with
their lives. You might as well teach a Zulu lace-work, instead of the
use of the assagai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Mr. Risley,&rdquo; said the school-master,
his face flushing, &ldquo;is not&mdash;I beg your pardon, of
course&mdash;this view of yours a little narrow and
ultra-conservative? You do not want to establish a permanent
factory-operative class in this country, do you? That is what your
theory would ultimately tend towards. Ought not these children be
given their chance to rise in the ranks; ought they to be condemned
to tread in the same path as their fathers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have those little paths which intersect every
unoccupied field in this locality worn by the feet of these men and
their children after them unto the third and fourth
generation,&rdquo; said Risley. &ldquo;If not, where is our skilled
labor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Risley,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd, anxiously,
&ldquo;you wouldn't want all those dear little children to work as
hard as their fathers, and not do any better, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they don't, who is going to make our shoes, dear Mrs.
Lloyd?&rdquo; asked Risley.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd and the school-master stared at him, and Lloyd laughed
his low, almost mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you know, Edward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Mr.
Risley is not in earnest, and speaks with the deadly intent of an
anarchist with a bomb in his bag? He is the most out-and-out radical
in the country. If there were a strike, and I did not yield to the
demands of the oppressed, and imported foreign labor, I don't know
that my life would be safe from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you do approve of a higher education?&rdquo; asked the
school-master, while Mrs. Lloyd stared from one to the other in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we and our posterity have to go barefoot,&rdquo;
said Risley, laughing out with a sudden undertone of seriousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose everybody could get accustomed to going barefoot
after a while,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd. &ldquo;Do you suppose that
dear little thing was barefooted when she ran away,
Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Risley answered as if he had been addressed. &ldquo;I can vouch
for the fact that she was not, Mrs. Lloyd,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They would sooner have walked on red-hot ploughshares
themselves than let her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her father is getting quite an old man,&rdquo; Norman Lloyd
said, with no apparent relevancy, as if he were talking to
himself.</p>

<p>All the time Cynthia Lennox had been quietly sitting at the head
of the table. When the rest of the company had gone, and she and
Risley were alone, seated in the drawing-room before the parlor fire,
for it was a chilly day, she turned her fair, worn face towards him
on the crimson velvet of her chair. &ldquo;Do you know why I did not
speak and tell them where the child was that time?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of your own good sense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; because of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her adoringly. She was older than he, her beauty
rather recorded than still evident on her face; she had been to him
from the first like a fair, forbidden flower behind a wall of
prohibition, but nothing could alter his habit of loving her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It was more on your account
than on my own; confession would be good for the soul. The secret has
always rankled in my pride. I would much rather defy opinion than fly
before it. But I know that you would mind. However, there was another
reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated a little and colored, even laughed a little,
embarrassed laugh which was foreign to her. &ldquo;Well,
Lyman,&rdquo; said she, finally, &ldquo;one reason why I did not
speak was that I see my way clear to making up to that child and her
parents for any wrong which I may have done them by causing them a
few hours' anxiety. When she has finished the high-school I mean to
send her to college.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XV</h3>

<p>When Ellen was about sixteen, in her second year at the
high-school, her own family never looked at her without a slight
shock of wonder, as before the unexpected. Her mates, being
themselves in the transition state, received her unquestioningly as a
fellow-traveller, and colored like themselves with the new lights of
the journey. But Ellen's father and mother and grandmother never
ceased regarding her with astonishment and admiration and something
like alarm. While they regarded Ellen with the utmost pride, they
still privately regretted this perfection of bloom which was the
forerunner of independence of the parent stalk&mdash;at least, Andrew
did. Andrew had grown older and more careworn; his mine had not yet
paid any dividends, but he had scattering jobs of work, and with his
wife's assistance had managed to rub along, and his secret was still
safe.</p>

<p>One day in February there was a half-holiday. Lloyd's was shut for
the rest of the day, for his brother in St. Louis was dead, and had
been brought to Rowe to be buried, and his funeral was at two
o'clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goin' to the funeral, old man?&rdquo; one of Andrew's
fellow-workmen had asked, jostling him as he went out of the shop at
noon. Before Andrew could answer, another voice broke in fiercely. It
belonged to Joseph Atkins, who was ghastly that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't goin' to no funerals,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;guess
they won't shut up shop for mine.&rdquo;  Then he coughed. His
daughter Abby, who had been working in the factory for some time
then, pressed close behind her father, and the expression in her face
was an echo of his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I strike, that's what I'm going to strike for&mdash;to
have the shop shut up the day of my funeral,&rdquo; said she; and the
remark had a ghastly flippancy, contradicted by her intense manner. A
laugh went around, and a young fellow with a handsome, unshaven face
caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better strike to have the shop shut up the day you're
married,&rdquo; said he; but Abby flung away from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll thank you to let me alone, Tom Hardy,&rdquo; she said,
with a snap; and the men laughed harder.</p>

<p>Abby was attractive to men in spite of her smallness and leanness
and incisiveness of manner. She was called mighty smart and dry,
which was the shop synonym for witty, and her favors, possibly
because she never granted them, were accounted valuable. Abby Atkins
had more admirers than many a girl who was prettier and presumably
more winning in every way, and could have married twice to their
once. But Abby had no wish for a lover. &ldquo;I've got all I can do
to earn my own living and the living of them that belong to
me,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>That afternoon Andrew Brewster stayed at home. After dinner Eva
Tenny and her little girl came in, and Ellen went down street on an
errand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes Brewster was crossing her yard to her son's house
when she saw Ellen passing, and paused to gaze at her with that
superb pride which pertains to self and is yet superior to it. It was
the idealized pride of her own youth. When she proceeded again
against the February gusts, it was with an unconscious aping of her
granddaughter's freedom of gait. Mrs. Zelotes wore an old red
cashmere scarf crossed over her bosom; she held up her black skirts
in front, and they trailed pointedly in the rear; she also stood well
back on her heels, and when she paused in the wind-swept yard
presented a curious likeness to an old robin pausing for reconnoitre.
Fanny and Eva Tenny in the next house saw her coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at her holding up her dress in front and letting it
drag in the back,&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;It always seemed to me
there was somethin' wrong about any woman that held up her dress in
front and let it drag behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva retained all the coarse beauty of her youth, but lines of
unalterable hardness were fixed on her forehead and at her mouth
corners, and the fierce flush in her cheeks was as set as paint. Her
beauty had endured the siege; no guns of mishaps could affect it, but
that charm of evanescence which awakens tenderness was gone. Jim
Tenny's affection seemed to be waning, and Eva looked at herself in
the glass even when bedecked with tawdry finery, and owned that she
did not wonder. She strained up her hair into the latest perkiness of
twist, and crimped it, and curled her feathers, and tied her ribbons
not as much in hope as in a stern determination to do her part
towards the furbishing of her faded star of attraction. &ldquo;Jim
don't act as if he thought so much of me, an' I dun'no' as I
wonder,&rdquo; she told her sister.</p>

<p>Fanny looked at her critically. &ldquo;You mean you ain't so
good-lookin' as you used to be?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Eva nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that is all men care for us,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't,&rdquo; said Eva, &ldquo;only it's the key to it.
It's like losin' the key and not bein' able to get in the door in
consequence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wa'n't my husband's key,&rdquo; said Fanny, with a
glance at her own face, faded as to feature and bloom, but
intensified as to love and daily duty, like that of a dog sharpened
to one faithfulness of existence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew ain't Jim,&rdquo; said Eva, shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he ain't,&rdquo; Fanny assented, with emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wouldn't swap off my husband for a dozen of
yours,&rdquo; said Eva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn't swap off mine for a thousand of
yours,&rdquo; returned Fanny, sharply; and there might have been one
of the old-time tussles between the sisters had not Eva's violent,
half-bitter sense of humor averted it. She broke into a hard
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I dun'no' as I should
want a thousand like Jim. Seems to me it would be considerable
care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny began to speak, but checked herself. She had heard rumors
regarding Jim Tenny of late and had flown fiercely with denial at the
woman who told her, and had not repeated them to her sister.</p>

<p>She was thinking how she had heard that Jim had been seen driving
in Wenham with Aggie Morse several times lately. Aggie Morse had been
Aggie Bemis, Jim's old sweetheart. She had married a well-to-do
merchant in Wenham, who died six months before and left her with
considerable property. It was her own smart little turn-out in which
she had been seen with Jim.</p>

<p>Eva was working in the shop, and Jim had been out of employment
for nearly a year, and living on his wife. There was a demand for
girls and not for men just then, so Jim loafed. His old mother cared
for the house as well as she was able, and Eva did the rest nights
and mornings. At first Jim had tried to help about the house-work,
but Eva had interfered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't a man's work,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Your mother
can leave the hard part of it till I get home.&rdquo;  Eva used to
put the money she earned surreptitiously into her husband's pockets
that he might not feel his manly pride injured, but she defeated her
own ends by her very solicitude. Jim Tenny began to reason that his
wife saw his shame and ignominious helplessness, else she would not
have been so anxious to cover it. The stoop of discouragement which
Eva used to fear for his shoulders did not come, but, instead,
something worse&mdash;the defiant set-back of recklessness. He took
his wife's earnings and despised himself. Whenever he paid a bill, he
was sure the men in the store said, the minute his back was turned,
&ldquo;It's his wife's money that paid for that.&rdquo;  He took to
loafing on sunny corners, and eying the passers-by with the blank
impudence of regard of those outside the current of life. When his
wife passed by on her way from the shop he nodded to her as if she
were a stranger, and presently followed her home at a distance. He
would not be seen on the street with her if he could avoid it. If by
any chance when he was standing on his corner of idleness his little
girl came past, he melted away imperceptibly. He could not bear it
that the child should see him standing there in that company of
futility and openly avowed inadequacy. The child was a keen-eyed,
slender little girl, resembling neither father nor mother, but
looking rather like her paternal grandmother, who was a fair,
attenuated woman, with an intelligence which had sharpened on herself
for want of anything more legitimate, and worn her out by the
unnatural friction. The little Amabel, for Eva had been romantic in
the naming of her child, was an old-fashioned-looking child in spite
of Eva's careful decoration of the little figure in the best childish
finery which she could muster.</p>

<p>Little Amabel was reading a child's book at another window. When
Mrs. Zelotes entered she eyed her with the sharpness and inscrutable
conclusions therefrom of a kitten, then turned a leaf in her
book.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Zelotes had greeted her daughter-in-law and Eva, she
looked with disapproval at Amabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was a little girl I should have been punished if I
hadn't got up and curtsied and said good-afternoon when company came
in,&rdquo; she remarked, severely.</p>

<p>Amabel was not a favorite outside of her own family. People used
to stare aghast at her unexpected questions and demands delivered in
a shrill clarion as from some summit of childish wisdom, and they
said she was a queer child. She yielded always to command from utter
helplessness, but the why of obedience was strongly alert within her.
The child might have been in some subtle and uncanny fashion the
offspring of her age and generation instead of her natural parents,
she was so unlike either of them, and so much a product of the times,
with her meekness and slavishness of weakness and futility, and her
unquenchable and unconquerable vitality of dissent.</p>

<p>Ellen adored the little Amabel. Presently, when she returned from
her errand down-town, she cried out with delight when she saw her;
and the child ran to meet her, and clung to her, with her flaxen head
snuggled close to her cheek. Ellen caught the child up, seated
herself, and sat cuddling her as she used to cuddle her doll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dear little thing!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;you dear
little thing! You did come to see Ellen, didn't you?&rdquo;  And the
child gazed up in the young girl's face with a rapt expression.
Nothing can express the admiration, which is almost as unquestionable
as worship, of a very little girl for a big one. Amabel loved her
mother with a rather unusual intensity for a child, but Ellen was
what she herself would be when she was grown up. Through Ellen her
love of self and her ambition budded into blossom. Ellen could do
nothing wrong because she did what she herself would do when she was
grown. She never questioned Ellen for her reasons.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes kept looking at the two, with pride in Ellen and
disapproval of her caresses of the child. &ldquo;Seems to me you
might speak to your own folks as well as to have no eyes for anybody
but that child,&rdquo; she said, finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, grandma, I spoke to you just a little while
ago,&rdquo; returned Ellen. &ldquo;You know I saw you just a few
minutes before I went down-town.&rdquo;  Ellen straightened the child
on her knees, and began to try to twist her soft, straight flaxen
locks into curls. Andrew lounged in from the kitchen and sat down and
regarded Ellen fondly. The girl's cheeks were a splendid color from
her walk in the cold wind, her hair around her temples caught the
light from the window, and seemed to wreathe her head with a yellow
flame. She tossed the child about with lithe young arms, whose every
motion suggested reserves of tender strength. Ellen was more
beautiful than she had ever been before, and yet something was gone
from her face, though only temporarily, since the lines for the
vanished meaning was still there. All the introspection and
dreaminess and poetry of her face were gone, for the girl was, for
the time, overbalanced on the physical side of her life. The joy of
existence for itself alone was intoxicating her. The innocent
frivolities of her sex had seized her too, and the instincts which
had not yet reached her brain nor gone farther than her bounding
pulses of youth. &ldquo;Ellen is getting real fond of dress,&rdquo;
Fanny often said to Andrew. He only laughed at that. &ldquo;Well,
pretty birds like pretty feathers, and no wonder,&rdquo; said he. But
he did not laugh when Fanny added that Ellen seemed to think more
about the boys than she used to. There was scarcely a boy in the
high-school who was not Ellen's admirer. It was a curious happening
in those days when Ellen was herself in much less degree the stuff of
which dreams are made than she had been and would be thereafter, that
she was the object of so many. Every morning when she entered the
school-room she was reflected in a glorious multiple of ideals in no
one could tell how many boyish hearts. Floretta Vining began to
imitate her, and kept close to Ellen with supremest diplomacy, that
she might thereby catch some of the crumbs of attention which fell
from Ellen's full table. Often when some happy boy had secured a
short monopoly of Ellen, his rival took up with Floretta, and she was
content, being one of those purely feminine things who have no pride
when the sweets of life are concerned. Floretta dressed her hair like
Ellen's, and tied her neck-ribbons the same way; she held her head
like her, she talked like her, except when the two girls were
absolutely alone; then she sometimes relapsed suddenly, to Ellen's
bewilderment, into her own ways, and her blue eyes took on an
expression as near animosity as her ingratiating politic nature could
admit.</p>

<p>Ellen did not affiliate as much with Floretta as with Maria
Atkins. Abby had gone to work in the shop, and so Ellen did not see
so much of her. Maria was not as much a favorite with the boys as she
had been since they had passed and not yet returned to that stage
when feminine comradeship satisfies; so Ellen used to confide in her
with a surety of sympathy and no contention. Once, when the girls
were sleeping together, Ellen made a stupendous revelation to Maria,
having first bound her to inviolable secrecy. &ldquo;I love a
boy,&rdquo; said she, holding Maria's little arm tightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know who,&rdquo; said Maria, with a hushed voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He kissed me once, and then I knew it,&rdquo; said
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess he loves you,&rdquo; said Maria. Ellen
shivered and drew a fluttering sigh of assent. Then the two girls lay
in each other's arms, looking at the moonlight which streamed in
through the window. God knew in what realms of pure romance, and of
passion so sublimated by innocence that no tinge of earthliness
remained, the two wandered in their dreams.</p>

<p>At last, that afternoon in February, Ellen put down little Amabel
and got out her needle-work. She was making a lace neck-tie for her
own adornment. She showed it to her grandmother at her mother's
command. &ldquo;It's real pretty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes.
&ldquo;Ellen takes after the Brewsters; they were always handy with
their needles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can uncle sew?&rdquo; asked little Amabel, suddenly, from
her corner, in a tone big with wonder.</p>

<p>Eva and the others chuckled, but Mrs. Zelotes eyed the child
severely. &ldquo;Little girls shouldn't ask silly questions,&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>Andrew passed his hand with a rough caress over the small flaxen
head. &ldquo;Uncle Andrew can't sew anything but shoes,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>Little Amabel's question had aroused in Mrs. Zelotes a carping
spirit even against Ellen. Presently she turned to her. &ldquo;I
heard something about you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I want to know if
it is true. I heard that you were walking home from school with that
Joy boy one day last week.&rdquo;  Ellen looked at her grandmother
without flinching, though the pink was over her face and neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes'm, I did,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it's about time it was put a stop to,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Zelotes. &ldquo;That Joy boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Fanny lost her temper. &ldquo;I can manage my own daughter,
Grandma Brewster,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I'll thank you to
attend to your own affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't seem to know enough to manage her,&rdquo;
retorted Mrs. Zelotes, &ldquo;if you let her go traipsin' round with
that Joy boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The warfare waged high for a time. Andrew withdrew to the kitchen.
Ellen took little Amabel up in her own chamber and showed her her
beautiful doll, which looked not a day older, so carefully had she
been cherished, than when she first had her. Ellen felt both
resentment and shame, and also a fierce dawning of partisanship
towards Granville Joy. &ldquo;Why should my grandmother speak of him
so scornfully?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;He is a real good
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night was very cold, a night full of fierce white glitter of
frost and moonlight, and raging with a turbulence of winds. Ellen lay
awake listening to them. Presently between the whistle of the wind
she heard another, a familiar pipe from a boyish throat. She sprang
out of bed and peeped from her window, and there was a dark, slight
figure out in the yard, and he was looking up at her window,
whistling. Shame, and mirth, and also exultation, which overpowered
them both, stirred within the child's breast. She had read of things
like this. Here was her boy lover coming out this bitter night just
for the sake of looking up at her window. She adored him for it. Then
she heard a window raised with a violent rasp across the yard, and
saw her grandmother's night-capped head thrust forth. She heard her
shrill, imperious voice call out quite distinctly, &ldquo;Boy, who be
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lovelorn whistler ceased his pipe, and evidently, had he
consulted his own discretion, would have shown a pair of flying
heels, but he walked bravely up to the window and the night-capped
head and replied. Ellen could not hear what he said, but she
distinguished plainly enough her grandmother's concluding
remarks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Zelotes; &ldquo;go home just as
fast as you can and go to bed. Go home!&rdquo;  Mrs. Zelotes made a
violent shooting motion with her hands and her white head as if he
were a cat, and Granville Joy obeyed. However, Ellen heard his brave,
retreating whistle far down the road. She went back to bed, and lay
awake with a fervor of young love roused into a flame by opposition
swelling high in her heart. But the next afternoon, after school,
Ellen, to Granville Joy's great bliss and astonishment, insinuated
herself, through the crowd of out-going scholars, close to him, and
presently, had he not been so incredulous, for he was a modest boy,
he would have said it was by no volition of his own that he found
himself walking down the street with her. And when they reached his
house, which was only half-way to her own, she looked at him with
such a wistful surprise as he motioned to leave her that he could not
mistake it, and he walked on at her side quite to her own house.
Granville Joy was a gentle boy, young for his age, which was a year
more than Ellen's. He had a face as gentle as a girl's, and really
beautiful. Women all loved him, and the school-girls raised an
admiring treble chorus in his praise whenever his name was spoken. He
was saved from effeminacy by nervous impulses which passed for
sustained manly daring. &ldquo;He once licked a boy a third bigger
than he was, and you needn't call him sissy,&rdquo; one girl said
once to a decrying friend. To-day, as the boy and girl neared Mrs.
Zelotes's house, Granville was conscious of an inward shrinking
before the remembrance of the terrible old lady. He expected every
minute to hear the grating upward slide of the window and that old
voice, which had in it a terrible intimidation of feminine will.
Granville had a mother as gentle as himself, and a woman with the
strength of her own conviction upon her filled him with awe as of
something anomalous. He wondered uneasily what he should do if the
old lady were to hail him and call him to an account again, whether
it would be a more manly course to face her, or obey, since she was
Ellen's grandmother. He kept an uneasy eye upon the house, and
presently, when he saw the stern old face at the window, he quailed a
little. But Ellen for the first time in her life took his arm, and
the two marched past under the fire of Mrs. Zelotes's gaze. Ellen had
retaliated, not nobly, but as naturally under the conditions of her
life at that time as the branch of a tree blows east before the west
wind.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XVI</h3>

<p>Ellen, when she graduated, was openly pronounced the flower of her
class. Not a girl equalled her, not a boy surpassed her. When Ellen
came home one night about two months before her graduation, and
announced that she was to have the valedictory, such a light of pure
joy flashed over her mother's face that she looked ten years
younger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess your father will be pleased enough,&rdquo;
she said. She was hard at work, finishing women's wrappers of cheap
cotton. The hood industry had failed some time before, since the
hoods had gone out of fashion. The same woman had taken a contract to
supply a large firm with wrappers, and employed many in the
neighborhood, paying them the smallest possible prices. This woman
was a usurer on a scale so pitiful and petty that it almost condoned
usury. Sometimes a man on discovering the miserable pittance for
which his wife toiled during every minute which she could snatch from
her household duties and the care of her children, would inveigh
against it. &ldquo;That woman is cheating you,&rdquo; he would say,
to be met with the argument that she herself was only making ten
cents on a wrapper. Looked at in that light, the wretched profit of
the workers did not seem so out of proportion. It was usury in a
nutshell, so infinitesimal as almost to escape detection. Fanny
worked every minute which she could secure on these
wrappers&mdash;the ungainly, slatternly home-gear of other poor
women. There was an air of dejected femininity and slipshod drudgery
about every fold of one of them when it was hung up finished. Fanny
used to keep them on a row of hooks in her bedroom until a dozen were
completed, when she carried them to her employer, and Ellen used to
look at them with a sense of depression. She imagined worn, patient
faces of the sisters of poverty above the limp collars, and poor,
veinous hands dangling from the clumsy sleeves.</p>

<p>Fanny would never allow Ellen to assist her in this work, though
she begged hard to do so. &ldquo;Wait till you get out of
school,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You've got enough to do while you are
in school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Ellen told her about the valedictory, Fanny was so overjoyed
that she lost sight of her work, and sewed in the sleeves wrong.
&ldquo;There, only see what you have made me do!&rdquo; she cried,
laughing with delight at her own folly. &ldquo;Only see, you have
made me sew in both these sleeves wrong. You are a great child.
Another time you had better keep away with your valedictories till I
get my wrapper finished.&rdquo;  Ellen looked up from the book which
she had taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me rip them out for you, mother,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you keep on with your study&mdash;it won't take me but
a minute. I don't know what your father will say. It is a great honor
to be chosen to write the valedictory out of that big class. I guess
your father will be pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I can write a good one,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you can't, I'd give up my beat,&rdquo; said the
mother, looking at her with enthusiasm, and speaking with scornful
chiding. &ldquo;Why don't you go over and tell your grandmother
Brewster? She'll be tickled 'most to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen had not been gone long when Andrew came home, coming into
the yard, bent as if beneath some invisible burden of toil. Just then
he had work, but not in Lloyd's. He had grown too old for Lloyd's,
and had been discharged long ago.</p>

<p>He had so far been able to conceal from Fanny the fact that he had
withdrawn all his little savings to invest in that mining stock. The
stock had not yet come up, as he had expected. He very seldom had a
circular reporting progress nowadays. When he did have one in the
post-office his heart used to stand still until he had torn open the
envelope and read it. It was uniformly not so hopeful as formerly,
while speciously apologetic. Andrew still had faith, although his
heart was sick with its long deferring. He could not actually believe
that all his savings were gone, sunken out of sight forever in this
awful shaft of miscalculation and misfortune. What he dreaded most
was that Fanny should find out, as she would have to were he long out
of employment.</p>

<p>Andrew, when he entered the house on his return from work, had
come to open a door into the room where his wife was, with a
deprecating and apologetic air. He gained confidence when, after a
few minutes, the sore subject had not been broached.</p>

<p>To-night, as usual, when he came into the sitting-room where Fanny
was sewing it was with a sidelong glance of uneasy deprecation
towards her, and an attempt to speak easily, as if he had nothing on
his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty warm day,&rdquo; he began, but his wife cut him
short. She faced around towards him beaming, her work&mdash;a pink
wrapper&mdash;slid from her lap to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Andrew?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What do
you s'pose has happened? Guess.&rdquo;  Andrew laughed gratefully,
and with the greatest alacrity. Surely this was nothing about
mining-stocks, unless, indeed, she had heard, and the stocks had gone
up, but that seemed to much like the millennium. He dismissed that
from his mind before it entered. He stood before her in his worn
clothes. He always wore a collar and a black tie, and his haggard
face was carefully shaven. Andrew was punctiliously neat, on Ellen's
account. He was always thinking, suppose he should meet Ellen coming
home from school, with some young ladies whose fathers were rich and
did not have to work in the shop, how mortified she might feel if he
looked shabby and unkempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess, Andrew,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see what it can be, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ellen has got the valedictory. What's the matter with
you? Be you deaf? Ellen has got the valedictory out of all them girls
and boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has, has she?&rdquo; said Andrew. He dropped into a
chair and looked at his wife. There was something about the intense
interchange of confidence of delight between these two faces of
father and mother which had almost the unrestraint of lunacy.
Andrew's jaw fairly dropped with his smile, which was a silent laugh
rather than a smile; his eyes were wild with delight. &ldquo;She has,
has she?&rdquo; he kept repeating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has,&rdquo; said Fanny. She tossed her head with
an incomparable pride; she coughed a little, affected cough. &ldquo;I
s'pose you know what a compliment it is?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It
means that she's smarter than all them boys and girls&mdash;the
smartest one in her whole class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I s'pose it does,&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;So she
has got it! Well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she comes now,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;and Grandma
Brewster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew borrowed money to buy a gold watch and chain for a
graduating gift for his daughter. He would scarcely have essayed
anything quite so magnificent, but Fanny innocently tempted him. The
two had been sitting in the door in the cool of the evening, one day
in June, about two weeks before the graduation, and had just watched
Ellen's light muslin skirts flutter out of sight. She had gone
down-town to purchase some ribbon for her graduating dress&mdash;she
and Floretta Vining, who had come over to accompany her. &ldquo;I
feel kind of anxious to have her have something pretty when she
graduates,&rdquo; Fanny said, speaking as if she were feeling her way
into a mind of opposition. Neither she nor Andrew had ever owned a
watch, and the scheme seemed to her breathless with magnificence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she ought to have something pretty,&rdquo; agreed
Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want her to feel ashamed when she sees the other
girls' presents,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; assented Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;I've been
thinkin'&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I've been thinkin' that&mdash;of course your mother
is goin' to give her the dress, and that's all, of course, and it's a
real handsome present. I ain't sayin' a word against that; but there
ain't anybody else to give her much except us. Poor Eva 'd like to,
but she can't; it takes all she earns, since Jim's out of work, and I
don't know what she's goin' to do. So that leaves nobody but us, and
I've been thinkin'&mdash;I dun'no' what you'll say, Andrew, but I've
been thinkin'&mdash;s'pose you took a little money out of the bank,
and&mdash;got Ellen&mdash;a watch.&rdquo;  Fanny spoke the last word
in a faint whisper. She actually turned pale in the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A watch?&rdquo; repeated Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a watch. I've always wanted Ellen to have a gold watch
and chain. I've always thought she could, and so she could if you
hadn't been out of work so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she could,&rdquo; said Andrew&mdash;&ldquo;a watch and
mebbe a piano. I thought I'd be back in Lloyd's before now. Well,
mebbe I shall before long. They say there's better times comin' by
fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ellen will be graduated by that time,&rdquo; said
Fanny, &ldquo;and she ought to have the watch now if she's ever goin'
to. She'll never think so much of it. Floretta Vining is goin' to
have a watch, too. Mrs. Cross says her mother told her so; said Mr.
Vining had it all bought&mdash;a real handsome one. I don't believe
Sam Vining can afford to buy a gold watch. I don't believe it is all
gold, for my part. They 'ain't got as much as we have, if Sam has had
work steadier. I don't believe it's gold. I don't want Ellen to have
a watch at all unless it's a real good one. It seems to me you'd
better take a little money out and buy her one, Andrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll see,&rdquo; said Andrew. He had a terrible sense
of guilt before Fanny. Suppose she knew that there was no money at
all in the bank to take out?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll buy her one if you say so,&rdquo; said he, in a
curious, slow, stern voice. In his heart was a fierce rising of
rebellion, that he, hard-working and frugal and self-denying all his
life, should be denied the privilege of buying a present for his
darling without resorting to deception, and even almost robbery. He
did not at that minute blame himself in the least for his
misadventure with his mining stock. Had not the same relentless
Providence driven him to that also? His weary spirit took for the
first time a poise of utter self-righteousness in opposition to this
Providence, and he blasphemed in his inner closet of self, before the
face of the Lord, as he comprehended it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have a sort of set my heart on it,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall have the watch,&rdquo; repeated Andrew, and his
voice was fairly defiant.</p>

<p>After Fanny had gone into the house and lighted her lamp, and
resumed work on her wrapper, Andrew still sat on the step in the cool
evening. There was a full moon, and great masses of shadows seemed to
float and hover and alight on the earth with a gigantic brooding as
of birds. The trees seemed redoubled in size from the soft
indetermination of the moonlight which confused shadow and light, and
deceived the eye as with soft loomings out of false distances. There
was a tall pine, grown from a sapling since Ellen's childhood, and
that looked more like a column of mist than a tree, but the Norway
spruces clove the air sharply like silhouettes in ink, and outlined
their dark profiles clearly against the silver radiance.</p>

<p>To Andrew, looking at it all, came the feeling of a traveller who
passes all scenes whether of joy or woe, being himself in his passing
the one thing which remains, and somehow he got from it an enormous
comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We're all travellin' along,&rdquo; he said aloud, in a
strained, solemn voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say, Andrew?&rdquo; Fanny called from the open
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin',&rdquo; replied Andrew.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XVII</h3>

<p>Ellen had always had objective points, as it were, in her life,
and she always would have, no matter how long she lived. She came to
places where she stopped mentally, for retrospection and forethought,
wherefrom she could seem to obtain a view of that which lay behind,
and of the path which was set for her feet in advance. She saw the
tracked and the trackless. Once, going with Abby Atkins and Floretta
in search of early spring flowers, Ellen had lingered and let them go
out of sight, and had sat down on a springing mat of wintergreen
leaves under the windy outstretch of a great pine, and had remained
there quite deaf to shrill halloos. She had sat there with eyes of
inward scrutiny like an Eastern sage's, motionless as on a rock of
thought, while her daily life eddied around her. Ellen, sitting
there, had said to herself: &ldquo;This I will always remember. No
matter how long I live, where I am, and what happens to me, I will
always remember how I was a child, and sat here this morning in
spring under the pine-tree, looking backward and forward. I will
never forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When, finally, Abby and Floretta had run back, and spied her
there, they had stared half frightened. &ldquo;You ain't sick, are
you, Ellen?&rdquo; asked Abby, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you sitting there for?&rdquo; asked Floretta.</p>

<p>Ellen had replied that she was not sick, and had risen and run on,
looking for flowers, but the flowers for her bloomed always against a
background of the past, and nodded with forward flings of fragrance
into the future; for the other children, who were wholly of their own
day and generation, they bloomed in the simple light of their own
desire of possession. They picked only flowers, but Ellen picked
thoughts, and they kept casting bewildered side-glances at her, for
the look which had come into her eyes as she sat beneath the
pine-tree lingered.</p>

<p>It was as if a rose had a second of self-consciousness between the
bud and the blossom; a bird between its mother's brooding and the
song. She had caught sight of the innermost processes of things, of
her wheels of life.</p>

<p>Ellen waked up on that June morning, and the old sensation of a
pause before advance was upon her, and the strange solemnity which
was almost a terror, from the feeble clutching of her mind at the
comprehension of infinity. She looked at the morning sunlight coming
between the white slants of her curtains, an airy flutter of her new
dress from the closet, her valedictory, tied with a white satin
ribbon, on the stand, and she saw quite plainly all which had led up
to this, and to her, Ellen Brewster; and she saw also the
inevitableness of its passing, the precious valedictory being laid
away and buried beneath a pile of future ones; she saw the crowd of
future valedictorians advancing like a flock of white doves in their
white gowns, when hers was worn out, and its beauty gone, pressing
forward, dimming her to her own vision. She saw how she would come to
look calmly and coldly upon all that filled her with such joy and
excitement to-day; how the savor of the moment would pass from her
tongue, and she said to herself that she would always remember this
moment.</p>

<p>Then suddenly&mdash;since she had in herself an impetus of motion
which nothing, not even reflection, could long check&mdash;she saw
quite plainly a light beyond, after all this should have passed, and
the leaping power of her spirit to gain it. And then, since she was
healthy, and given only at wide intervals to these Eastern lapses of
consciousness from the present, she was back in her day, and alive to
all its importance as a part of time.</p>

<p>She felt the bounding elation of tossing on the crest of her wave
of success, and the full rainbow glory of it dazzled her eyes. She
was first in her class, she was valedictorian, she had a beautiful
dress, she was young, she was first. It is a poor spirit, and one
incapable of courage in defeat, who feels not triumph in victory.
Ellen was triumphant and confident. She had faith in herself and the
love and approbation of everybody.</p>

<p>When she was seated with her class on the stage in the city hall,
where the graduating exercises were held, she saw herself just as she
looked, and it was with a satisfaction which had nothing weakly in
its vein, and smiled radiantly and innocently at herself as seen in
this mirror of love and appreciation of all who knew her.</p>

<p>When the band stopped playing, and Ellen, who as valedictorian
came last as the crown and capsheaf of it all, stepped forward from
the semicircle of white-clad girls and seriously abashed boys, there
was a subdued murmur and then a hush all over the hall. Andrew and
Fanny and the grandmother, seated directly in front of the
stage&mdash;for they had come early to secure good seats&mdash;heard
whispers of admiration on every side. It was admiration with no
dissent&mdash;such jealous ears as theirs could not be deceived.
Fanny's face was blazing with the sweet shame of pride in her child;
Andrew was pale; the grandmother sat as if petrified, with a proud
toss of her head. They looked straight ahead; they dared not
encounter each other's eyes, for they were more self-conscious than
Ellen. They felt the attention of the whole assembly upon them.
Andrew was conscious of feeling ill and faint. His own joy seemed to
overwhelm him. He forgot his stocks, he forgot his borrowed money, he
forgot Lloyd's; he was perfectly happy at the sight of that beautiful
young creature of his own heart, who was preferred before all others
in the sight of the whole city. In truth, there was about Ellen a
majesty and nobility of youth and innocence and beauty which
overawed. The other girls of the class were as young and as pretty,
but none of them had that indescribable quality which seemed to raise
her above them all. Ellen still kept her blond fairness, but there
was nothing of the doll-like which often characterizes the blond
type. Although she was small, Ellen's color had the firmness and
unwavering of tinted marble; she carried her crown of yellow braids
as if it had been gold; she moved and looked and spoke with decision.
The violent and intense temperament which she had inherited from two
sides of her family had crystallized in her to something more
forcible, but also more impressive. However, she was, after all, only
a young girl, scarcely more than a child, whatever her principle of
underlying character might be, and when she stood there before them
all&mdash;all her townspeople who represented her world, the human
shore upon which her own little individuality beat&mdash;when she saw
those attentive faces, row upon row, all fixed upon her, she felt her
heart pound against her side; she had no sensation of the roll of
paper in her hand; an awful terror as of suddenly discovered depths
came over her, as the wild clapping of hands to which her appearance
had given rise died away. Ellen stood still, holding the valedictory
as if it had been a stick. A little wondering murmur began to be
heard. Andrew felt as if he were dying. Fanny gripped his arm hard.
Mrs. Zelotes had the look of one about to spring. Ellen had the
terrible sensation which has in it a nightmare of inability to move,
allied with the intensest consciousness. She knew that she was to
read her valedictory, she knew that she must raise that
white-ribboned roll and read, or else be disgraced forever, and yet
she was powerless. But suddenly some compelling glance seemed to
arouse her from this lock of nerve and muscle; she raised her eyes,
and Cynthia Lennox, on the farther side of the hall, was gazing full
at her with an indescribable gaze of passion and help and command.
Her own mother's look could not have influenced her. Ellen raised her
valedictory, bowed, and began to read. Andrew looked so pale that
people nudged one another to look at him. Mrs. Zelotes settled back,
relaxing stiffly from her fierce attitude. Fanny wiped her forehead
with a cheap lace-bordered handkerchief. There was a stifled sob
farther back, that came from Eva Tenny, who sat back on account of a
break across the shoulders in the back of her silk dress. Amabel,
an&aelig;mic and eager in a little, tawdry, cheap muslin frock, sat
beside her, with worshipful eyes on Ellen. &ldquo;What ailed
her?&rdquo; she whispered, hitting her mother with a sharp little
elbow. &ldquo;Hush up!&rdquo; whispered Eva, angrily, surreptitiously
wiping her eyes. In front, directly in her line of vision, sat the
woman of whom she was jealous&mdash;the young widow, who had been
Aggie Bemis, arrayed in a handsome India silk and a flower-laden hat.
Eva's hat was trimmed with a draggled feather and a bunch of roses
which she had tried to color with aniline dye. When she got home that
night she tore the feather out of the hat and flung it across the
room. She wished to do it that afternoon every time she looked at the
other woman's roses against the smooth knot of her brown hair, and
that repressed impulse, with her alarm at Ellen's silence, had made
her almost hysterical. When Ellen's clear young voice rose and filled
the hall she calmed herself. Ellen had not folded back her first page
with a flutter of the white satin ribbons before people began to sit
straight and stare at each other incredulously. The subject of the
valedictory, as well as those of the other essays, had been allotted,
and Ellen's had been &ldquo;Equality,&rdquo; and she had written a
most revolutionary valedictory. Ellen had written with a sort of
poetic fire, and, crude as it all was, she might have had the
inspiration of a Shelley or a Chatterton as she stood there, raising
her fearless young front over the marshalling of her sentiments on
the smooth sheets of foolscap. Her voice, once started, rang out
clear and full. She had hesitated at nothing, she flung all castes
into a common heap of equality with her strong young arms, and she
set them all on one level of the synagogue. She forced the employer
and his employ&eacute; to one bench of service in the grand system of
things; she gave the laborer, and the laborer only, the reward of
labor. As Ellen went on reading calmly, with the steadfastness of one
promulgating principles, not the excitement of one carried away by
enthusiasm, she began to be interrupted by applause, but she read on,
never wavering, her clear voice overcoming everything. She was quite
innocently throwing her wordy bomb to the agitation of public
sentiment. She had no thought of such an effect. She was stating what
she believed to be facts with her youthful dogmatism. She had no fear
lest the facts strike too hard. The school-master's face grew long
with dismay; he sat pulling his mustache in a fashion he had when
disturbed. He glanced uneasily now and then at Mr. Lloyd, and at
another leading manufacturer who was present. The other manufacturer
sat quite stolid and unsmiling beside a fidgeting wife, who presently
arose and swept out with a loud rustle of silks. She looked back once
and beckoned angrily to her husband, but he did not stir. He was on
the school-board. The school-master trembled when he saw that
imperturbable face of storing recollection before him. Mr. Lloyd
leaned towards Lyman Risley, who sat beside him and whispered and
laughed. It was quite evident that he did not consider the flight of
this little fledgling in the face of things seriously. But even he,
as Ellen's clearly delivered sentiments grew more and more
defined&mdash;almost anarchistic&mdash;became a little grave in spite
of the absurd incongruity between them and the girlish lips. Once he
looked in some wonder at the school-teacher as much as to say,
&ldquo;Why did you permit this?&rdquo; and the young man pulled his
mustache harder.</p>

<p>When Ellen finished and made her bow, such a storm of applause
arose as had never before been heard at a high-school exhibition. The
audience was for the most part composed of factory employ&eacute;s
and their families, as most of the graduates were of that class of
the community. Many of them were of foreign blood, people who had
come to the country expecting the state of things advocated in
Ellen's valedictory, and had remained more or less sullen and
dissenting at the non-fulfilment of their expectation. One tall
Swede, with a lurid flashing of blue eyes under a thick, blond
thatch, led the renewed charges of applause. Red spots came on his
cheeks, gaunt with high cheekbones; his cold Northern blood was up.
He stood upreared against a background of the crowd under the
balcony; he stamped when the applause died low; then it swelled again
and again like great waves. The Swede brandished his long arms, he
shouted, others echoed him. Even the women hallooed in a frenzy of
applause, they clapped their hands, they stood up in their seats.
Only a few sat silent and contemptuous through all the enthusiasm.
Thomas Briggs, the manufacturer, was one of them. He sat like a rock,
his great, red, imperturbable face of dissent fixed straight ahead.
Mrs. Lloyd clapped wildly, on account of the girl who had read the
valedictory. She had slept through the greater part of it, for it was
very warm, and the heat always made her drowsy. She kept leaning
towards Cynthia as she clapped, and asking in a loud whisper if she
wasn't sweet. Cynthia did not applaud, but her delicate face was pale
with emotion. Lyman Risley, beside her, was clapping energetically.
&ldquo;She may have a bomb somewhere concealed among those ribbons
and frills,&rdquo; he said to Lloyd when the applause was waxing
loudest, and Lloyd laughed.</p>

<p>As for Ellen, when the storm of applause burst at her feet, she
stood still for a moment bewildered. Then she bowed again and turned
to go, then the compelling uproar brought her back. She stood there
quite piteous in her confusion. This was too much triumph, and,
moreover, she had not the least idea of the true significance of it
all. She was like a chemist who had brought together, quite
ignorantly and unwittingly, the two elements of an explosive. She
thought that her valedictory must have been well done, that they
liked it, and that was all. She had no sooner finished reading than
the ushers began in the midst of the storm of applause to approach
the stage with her graduating presents. They were laden with great
bouquets and baskets of flowers, with cards conspicuously attached to
most of them. Cynthia Lennox had sent a basket of roses. Ellen took
it on her arm, and wondered when she saw the name attached to the
pink satin bow on the handle. She did not look again towards Cynthia
since the old impulse of concealment on her account came over her.
Ellen had great boxes of candy from her boy admirers, that being a
favorite token of young affection upon such occasions. She had a
gift-book from her former school-teacher, and a ninety-eight-cent
gilded vase from Eva and Amabel, who had been saving money to buy it.
She heard a murmur of admiration when she had finally reached her
seat, after the storm of applause had at last subsided, and she
unrolled the packages with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, ain't that handsome!&rdquo; said Floretta, pressing her
muslin-clad shoulder against Ellen's. &ldquo;My, didn't they clap
you, Ellen! What's that in that package?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The package contained Ellen's new watch and chain. Floretta had
already received hers, and it lay in its case on her lap. Ellen
looked at the package, not hearing in the least the Baptist minister
who had taken his place on the stage, and was delivering an address.
She had felt her aunt Eva's and Amabel's eager eyes on her when she
unrolled the gaudy vase; now she felt her father's and mother's. The
small, daintily tied package was inscribed &ldquo;Ellen Brewster,
from Father and Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you open it?&rdquo; came in her ear from
Floretta. Maria was leaning forward also, over her lapful of
carnations which John Sargent had presented to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't she open it?&rdquo; she whispered to Floretta.
They were all quite oblivious of the speaker, who moved nervously
back and forth in front of them, so screening them somewhat from the
observation of the audience. Still Ellen hesitated, looking at the
little package and feeling her father's and mother's eyes on her
face.</p>

<p>Finally she untied the cord and took out the jeweller's case from
the wrapping-paper. &ldquo;My, you've got one too, I bet!&rdquo;
whispered Floretta. Ellen opened the box, and gazed at her watch and
chain; then she glanced at her father and mother down in the
audience, and the three loving souls seemed to meet in an ineffable
solitude in the midst of the crowd. All three faces were
pale&mdash;Ellen's began to quiver. She felt Floretta's shoulder warm
through her thin sleeve against hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! you've got one&mdash;I said so,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;It isn't chased as much as mine, but it's real handsome. My,
Ellen Brewster, you ain't going to cry before all these
people!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen smiled against a sob, and she gave her head a defiant toss.
Down in the audience Fanny had her handkerchief to her eyes, and
Andrew sat looking sternly at the speaker. Ellen said to herself that
she would not cry&mdash;she would not, but she sat gazing down at her
flower-laden lap and the presents. The golden disk under her fixed
eyes waxed larger and larger, until it seemed to fill her whole
comprehension as with a golden light of a suffering, self-denying
love which was her best reward of life and labor on the earth.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XVIII</h3>

<p>After the exhibition there was a dance. The Brewsters, even Mrs.
Zelotes, remained to see the last of Ellen's triumph. Mrs. Zelotes
was firmly convinced that Ellen's appearance excelled any one's in
the hall. Not a girl swung past them in the dance but she eyed her
white dress scornfully, then her rosy face, and sniffed with high
nostrils like an old war-horse. &ldquo;Jest look at that Vining
girl's dress, coarse enough to strain through,&rdquo; she said to
Fanny, leaning across Andrew, who was sitting rapt, his very soul
dancing with his daughter, his eyes never leaving her one second,
following her fair head and white flutter of muslin ruffles and
ribbons around the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that's so,&rdquo; assented Fanny, but not with her
usual sharpness. A wistful softness and sweetness was on her coarsely
handsome face. Once she reached her hand over Andrew's and pressed
it, and blushed crimson as she did so. Andrew turned and smiled at
her. All that annoyed Andrew was that Ellen danced with Granville Joy
often, and also with other boys. It disturbed him a little, even
while it delighted him, that she should dance at all, that she should
have learned to dance. Andrew had been brought up to look upon
dancing as an amusement for Louds rather than for Brewsters. It had
not been in vogue among the aristocracy of this little New England
city when he was young.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes watched Ellen dance with inward delight and outward
disapproval. &ldquo;I don't approve of dancing, never did,&rdquo; she
said to Andrew, but she was furious once when Ellen sat through a
dance. Towards the end of the evening she saw with sudden alertness
Ellen dancing with a new partner, a handsome young man, who carried
himself with more assurance than the school-boys. Mrs. Zelotes hit
Andrew with her sharp elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who's that dancing with her now?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's young Lloyd,&rdquo; answered Andrew. He flushed a
little, and looked pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Norman Lloyd's nephew?&rdquo; asked his mother,
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he's on here from St. Louis. He's goin' into business
with his uncle,&rdquo; replied Andrew. &ldquo;Sargent was telling me
about it yesterday. Young Lloyd came into the post-office while we
were there.&rdquo;  Fanny had been listening. Immediately she married
Ellen to young Lloyd, and the next moment she went to live in a grand
new house built in a twinkling in a vacant lot next to Norman Lloyd's
residence, which was the wonder of the city. She reared this castle
in Spain with inconceivable swiftness, even while she was turning her
head towards Eva on the other side, and prodding her with an
admonishing elbow as Mrs. Zelotes had prodded Andrew. &ldquo;That's
Norman Lloyd's nephew dancing with her now,&rdquo; she said. Eva
looked at her, smiling. Directly the idea of Ellen's marriage with
the young man with whom she was dancing established full connections
and ran through the line of Ellen's relatives as though an electric
wire.</p>

<p>As for Ellen, dancing with this stranger, who had been introduced
to her by the school-master, she certainly had no thought of a
possible marriage with him, but she had looked into his face with a
curious, ready leap of sympathy and understanding of this other soul
which she met for the first time. It seemed to her that she must have
known him before, but she knew that she had not. She began to reflect
as they were whirling about the hall, she gazed at that secret memory
of hers, which she had treasured since her childhood, and discovered
that what had seemed familiar to her about the young man was the face
of a familiar thought. Ever since Miss Cynthia Lennox had told her
about her nephew, the little boy who had owned and loved the doll,
Ellen had unconsciously held the thought of him in her mind.
&ldquo;You are Miss Cynthia Lennox's nephew,&rdquo; she said to young
Lloyd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. He nodded towards Cynthia, who was
sitting on the opposite side from the Brewsters, with the Norman
Lloyds and Lyman Risley. &ldquo;She used to be like a mother to
me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know I lost my mother when I was a
baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded at him with a look of pity of that marvellous scope
which only a woman in whom the maternal slumbers ready to awake can
compass. Ellen, looking at the handsome face of the young man, saw
quite distinctly in it the face of the little motherless child, and
all the tender pity which she would have felt for that child was in
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful girl she is,&rdquo; thought the young man.
He smiled at her admiringly, loving her look at him, while not in the
least understanding it. He had asked to be presented to Ellen from
curiosity. He had not been at the exhibition, and had heard the
school-master and Risley talking about the valedictory. &ldquo;I
didn't know that you taught anarchy in school, Mr. Harris,&rdquo;
Risley had said. He laughed as he said it, but Harris had colored
with an uneasy look at Norman Lloyd, whose face wore an expression of
amusement. &ldquo;Perhaps I should have,&rdquo; he began, but Lloyd
interrupted him. &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
don't imagine that any man in his senses could take seriously enough
to be annoyed by it that child's effusion on her nice little roll of
foolscap tied with her pretty white satin ribbon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is just as sweet as she can be,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Norman, &ldquo;and I thought her composition was real pretty. Didn't
you, Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied Cynthia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What your are worrying about it for, Edward, I don't
see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norman to the school-master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad if it struck you that way,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but when I heard the applause from all those factory
people&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice, since a number were sitting
near&mdash;&ldquo;I didn't know, but&mdash;&rdquo;  He hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the spark that would fire the mine might be in that
pretty little beribboned roll of foolscap,&rdquo; said Risley,
laughing. &ldquo;Well, it was a very creditable production, and it
was written with the energy of conviction. The Czar and that little
school-girl would not live long in one country, if she goes on as she
has begun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was then that young Lloyd, who had just come in, and was
standing beside the school-master, turned eagerly to him, and asked
who the girl was, and begged him to present him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he'll fall in love with her,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Norman, directly, when the two men had gone across the hall in quest
of Ellen. Her husband laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not seen your aunt for a long time,&rdquo; Ellen
said to young Lloyd, when they were sitting out a dance after their
waltz together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not since&mdash;I&mdash;I came on&mdash;with my father when
he died,&rdquo; he replied. Again Ellen looked at him with that
wonderful pity in her face, and again the young man thought he had
never seen such a girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think your aunt is beautiful,&rdquo; Ellen said,
presently, gazing across at Cynthia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she must have been a beauty when she was
young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she is now,&rdquo; said Ellen, quite fervently, for
she was able to disabuse her mind of associations and rely upon pure
observation, and it was quite true that leaving out of the question
Cynthia's age and the memory of her face in stronger lights at closer
view, she was as beautiful from where they sat as some graceful
statue. Only clear outlines showed at that distance, and her soft
hair, which was quite white, lay in heavy masses around the intense
repose of her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;s,&rdquo; admitted Robert, somewhat hesitatingly.
&ldquo;She used to think everything of me when I was a little
shaver,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn't she now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I suppose she does, but it is different now. I am
grown up. A man doesn't need so much done for him when he is grown
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then again he looked at Ellen with eyes of pleading which would
have made of the older woman what he remembered her to have been in
his childhood, and hers answered again.</p>

<p>Robert did not say anything to her about the valedictory until
just before the close of the evening, when their last dance together
was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I did not have a chance to hear your
valedictory,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I could not come
early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen blushed and smiled, and made the conventional school-girl
response. &ldquo;Oh, you didn't miss anything,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I did,&rdquo; said the young man, earnestly. Then
he looked at her and hesitated a little. &ldquo;I wonder if you would
be willing to lend it to me?&rdquo; he said, then. &ldquo;I would be
very careful of it, and would return it immediately as soon as I had
read it. I should be so interested in reading it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you wish,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;but I am
afraid you won't think it is good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I shall. I have been hearing about it, how good
it was, and how you broke up the whole house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen blushed. &ldquo;Oh, that was only because it was the
valedictory. They always clap a good deal for the
valedictory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was because it was you, you dear beauty,&rdquo; thought
the young man, gazing at her, and the impulse to take her in his arms
and kiss that blush seized upon him. &ldquo;I know they applauded
your valedictory because it was worthy of it,&rdquo; said he, and
Ellen's eyes fell before his, and the blush crept down over her
throat, and up to the soft toss of hair on her temples. The two were
standing, and the man gazed at Ellen's pink arms and neck through the
lace of her dress, those incomparable curves of youthful bloom shared
by a young girl and a rose; he gazed at that noble, fair head bent
not so much before him as before the mystery of life, of which a
perception had come to her through his eyes, and he said to himself
that there never was such a girl, and he also wondered if he saw
aright, he being one who seldom entirely lost the grasp of his own
leash. Having the fancy and the heart of a young man, he was given
like others of his kind to looking at every new girl who attracted
him in the light of a problem, the unknown quantity being her
possible interest for him, but he always worked it out calmly. He
kept himself out of his own shadow, when it came to the question of
emotions, in something the same fashion that his uncle Norman did.
Now, looking at Ellen Brewster with the whole of his heart setting
towards her in obedience to that law which had brought him into
being, he yet was saying quite coolly and loudly in his own inner
consciousness, &ldquo;Wait, wait, wait! Wait until to-morrow, see how
you feel then. You have felt in much this way before. Wait! Perhaps
you don't see it as it is. Wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He realized his own wisdom all the more clearly when Ellen led him
to the settee where her relatives sat guarding her graduation
presents and her precious valedictory. She presented him gracefully
enough. Ellen knew nothing of society etiquette, she had never
introduced such a young gentleman as this to any one in her life, but
her inborn dignity of character kept her self-poise perfect. Still,
when young Lloyd saw the mother coarsely perspiring and fairly
aggressive in her delight over her daughter, when poor Andrew hoped
he saw him well, and Mrs. Zelotes eyed him with sharp approbation,
and Eva, conscious of her shabbiness, bowed with a stiff toss of her
head and sat back sullenly, and little Amabel surveyed him with
uncanny wisdom divided between himself and Ellen, he became conscious
of a slight disappearance of his glamour. He thanked Ellen most
heartily for the privilege which she granted him, when she took the
valedictory from the heap of flowers, and took his leave with a bow
which made Fanny nudge Andrew, almost before the young man's back was
turned.</p>

<p>Then she looked at Ellen, but she said nothing. A sudden impulse
of delicacy prevented her. There was something about this beloved
daughter of hers which all at once seemed strange to her. She began
to associate her with the sacred mystery of life as she had never
done. Then, too, there was the more superficial association with one
of another class which she held in outward despite but inward
awe.</p>

<p>Ellen gathered up her presents into her lap, and sat there a few
minutes through the last dance, which she had refused to Granville
Joy, who went away with nervous alertness for another girl, and
nobody spoke to her.</p>

<p>When young Lloyd and Cynthia Lennox and the others left, as they
did directly, Fanny murmured, &ldquo;They've gone,&rdquo; and they
all knew what she meant. She was thinking&mdash;and so were they all,
except Ellen&mdash;that that was the reason, because he had to go,
that he had not asked Ellen for the last dance.</p>

<p>As for Ellen, she sat looking at her gold watch and chain, which
she had taken out of the case. Her face grew intensely sober, and she
did not notice when young Lloyd left. All at once she had reflected
how her father had never owned a watch in his whole life, though he
was a man, but he had given one to her. She reflected how he had so
little work, how shabby his clothes were, how he must have gone
without himself to buy this for her, and the girl had such a heart of
gold that it rose triumphantly loyal to its first loves and
tendernesses, and her father's old, worn face came between her and
that of the young man who might become her lover.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XIX</h3>

<p>The day after Ellen's graduation there might have been seen a
touching little spectacle passing along the main street of Rowe about
ten o'clock in the fore-noon. It was touching because it gave
evidence of that human vanity common to all, which strives to
perpetuate the few small, good things that come into the hard lives
of poor souls, and strives with such utter futility. Ellen held up
her fluffy skirts daintily, the wind caught her white ribbons and the
loose locks of her yellow hair under her white hat. She carried
Cynthia Lennox's basket of roses on her arm, and each of the others
was laden with bouquets. Little Amabel clasped both slender arms
around a great sheaf of roses; the thorns pricked through her thin
sleeves, but she did not mind that, so upborne with the elation of
the occasion was she. Her small, pale face gazed over the mass of
bloom with challenging of admiration from every one whom she met. She
was jealous lest any one should not look with full appreciation of
Ellen.</p>

<p>Ellen was the one in the little procession who had not unmixed
delight in it. She had a certain shamefacedness about going through
the streets in such a fashion. She avoided looking at the people whom
she met, and kept her head slightly bent and averted, instead of
carrying it with the proud directness which was her habit. She felt
vaguely that this was the element of purely personal vanity which
degrades a triumph, and the weakness of delight and gloating in the
faces of her relatives irritated her. It was a sort of unveiling of
love, and the girl was sensitive enough to understand it. &ldquo;Oh,
mother, I don't want to have us all go through the street with all
these flowers, and me in my white dress,&rdquo; she had said. She had
looked at her mother with a shrinking in her eyes which was
incomprehensible to the other coarser-natured woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;Sometimes you have
real silly notions, Ellen.&rdquo;  Fanny said it adoringly, for even
silliness in this girl was in a way worshipful to her. Ellen, with
her heart still softened almost to grief by the love shown her on the
day before, had yielded, but she was glad when they arrived at the
photograph studio. She had particularly dreaded passing Lloyd's, for
the thought came to her that possibly young Mr. Lloyd might see her.
She supposed that he was likely to be in the office. When they passed
the office-windows she looked the other way, but before she was well
past, her aunt Eva hit her violently and laughed loudly. Ellen
shrank, coloring a deep crimson. Then her mother also laughed, and
even Amabel, shrilly, with precocious recognition of the situation.
Only Mrs. Zelotes stalked along in silent dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't laugh so loud, he'll hear you,&rdquo; said she,
severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was that young man who was at the hall last night, and
he was looking at you awful sharp,&rdquo; said little Amabel to
Ellen, squeezing her warm arm, and sending out that shrill peal of
laughter again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't, dear,&rdquo; said Ellen. She felt humiliated, and
the more so because she was ashamed of being humiliated by her own
mother and aunt. &ldquo;Why should I be so sensitive to things in
which they see no harm?&rdquo; she asked herself, reprovingly.</p>

<p>As for young Lloyd, he had, ever since he parted with the girl the
night before, that sensation of actual contact which survives
separation, and had felt the light pressure of her hand in his all
night, and along with it that ineffable pain of longing which would
draw the substance of a dream to actuality and cannot. He saw her
with her coarsely exultant relatives, the inevitable blur of her
environments, and felt himself not so much disillusioned as
confirmed. He had been constantly saying to himself, when the girl's
face haunted his eyes, and her hand in his own, that he was a fool,
that he had felt so before, that he must have, that there was no
sense in it, that he was Robert Lloyd, and she a good girl, a
beautiful girl, but a common sort of girl, born of common people to a
common lot. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said to himself, with a kind of
bitter exultation, &ldquo;there, I told you so.&rdquo;  The
inconceivable folly of that glance of the mother at him, then at
Ellen, and the meaning laughter, repelled him to the point of
disgust. He turned his back to the window and resumed his work, but,
in spite of himself, the pathos of the picture which he had seen
began to force itself upon him, and he thought almost tenderly and
forgivingly that she, the girl, had not once looked his way. He even
wondered, pityingly, if she had been mortified and annoyed by her
mother's behavior. A great anger on Ellen's behalf with her mother
seized upon him. How pretty she did look moving along in that little
flower-laden procession, he thought, how very pretty. All at once a
desire for the photograph which would be taken seized him, for he
divined the photograph. However, he said to himself that he would
send back the valedictory which he had not yet read by post, with a
polite note, and that would be the end.</p>

<p>But it was only the next evening that Robert Lloyd with the
valedictory in hand got off the trolley-car in front of the Brewster
house. He had proved to himself that it was an act of actual rudeness
to return anything so precious and of so much importance to the owner
by the post, that he ought to call and deliver it in person. When he
regained his equilibrium from the quick sidewise leap from the car,
and stood hesitating a little, as one will do before a strange house,
for he was not quite sure as to his bearings, he saw a white blur as
of feminine apparel in the front doorway. He advanced tentatively up
the little path between two rows of flowering bushes, and Ellen
rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; she said, in a slightly
tremulous voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good-evening, Miss Brewster,&rdquo; he cried, quickly.
&ldquo;So I am right! I was not sure as to the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People generally tell by the cherry-trees in the
yard,&rdquo; replied Ellen, taking refuge from her timidity in the
security of commonplace observation, as she had done the night
before, giving thereby both a sense of disappointment and
elusiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you walk in?&rdquo; she added, with the prim
politeness of a child who accosts a guest according to rule and
precept. Ellen had never, in fact, had a young man make a formal call
upon her before. She reflected now, both with relief and trepidation,
that her mother was away, having gone to her aunt Eva's. She had an
instinct which she resented, that her mother and this young man were
on two parallels which could never meet. Her father was at home,
seated in the south door with John Sargent and Nahum Beals and Joe
Atkins, but she never thought of such a thing as her father's
receiving a young man caller, though she would not have doubted so
much his assimilating with Robert Lloyd. She understood that the
young man might look at her mother with dissent, while she resented
it, but with her father it was different.</p>

<p>The group of men at the south door were talking in loud, fervent
voices which seemed to rise and fall like waves. Nahum Beals's
strained, nervous tones were paramount. &ldquo;Mr. Beals is talking
about the labor question, and he gets quite excited,&rdquo; Ellen
remarked, somewhat apologetically, as she ushered young Lloyd into
the parlor.</p>

<p>Lloyd laughed. &ldquo;It sounds as if he were leading an
army,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very much in earnest,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>She placed painstakingly for her guest the best chair, which was a
spring rocker upholstered with crush-plush. The little parlor was
close and stuffy, and the kerosene-lamp, with the light dimmed by a
globe decorated with roses, heated the room still further. This lamp
was Fanny's pride. It had, in her eyes, the double glory of high art
and cheapness. She was fond of pointing at it, and inquiring,
&ldquo;How much do you think that cost?&rdquo; and explaining with
the air of one who expects her truth to be questioned that it only
cost forty-nine cents. This lamp was hideous, the shape was
aggressive, a discordant blare of brass, and the roses on the globe
were blasphemous. Somehow this lamp was the first thing which struck
Lloyd on entering the room. He could not take his eyes from it. As
for Ellen, long acquaintance had dulled her eyes. She sat in the full
glare of this hideous lamp, and Lloyd considered that she was not so
pretty as he had thought last night. Still, she was undeniably very
pretty. There was something in the curves of her shoulders, in her
pink-and-white cotton waist, that made one's fingers tingle, and
heart yearn, and there was an appealing look in her face which made
him smile indulgently at her as he might have done at a child. After
all, it was probably not her fault about the lamp, and lamps were a
minor consideration, and he was finical, but suppose she liked it?
Lloyd, sitting there, began to speculate if it were possible for
one's spiritual nature to be definitely damaged by hideous lamps.
Then he caught sight of a plate decorated with postage-stamps, with a
perforated edge through which ribbons were run, and he wondered if
she possibly made that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are undoubtedly perfectly moral people,&rdquo; he told
his aunt Cynthia afterwards, &ldquo;but I wonder that they keep such
an immoral plate.&rdquo;  However, that was before he fell in love
with Ellen, while he was struggling with himself in his desire to do
so, and making all manner of sport of himself by way of
hindrance.</p>

<p>Ellen at that age could have had no possible conception of the
sentiment with which the young man viewed her environment. She was
sensitive to spiritual discords which might arise from meeting with
another widely different nature, but when it came to material things,
she was at a loss. Then, too, she was pugnaciously loyal to the
glories of the best parlor. She was innocently glad that she had such
a nice room into which to usher him. She felt that the marble-top
table, the plush lambrequin on the mantle-shelf, the gilded vases,
the brass clock, the Nottingham lace curtains, the olive-and-crimson
furniture, the pictures in cheap gilt frames, the heavily gilded
wall-paper, and the throws of thin silk over the picture corners must
prove to him the standing of her family. She felt an ignoble
satisfaction in it, for a certain measure of commonness clung to the
girl like a cobweb. She was as yet too young to bloom free of her
environment, her head was not yet over the barrier of her daily lot;
her heart never would be, and that was her glory. Young Lloyd handed
her the roll of valedictory as soon as he entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you for allowing me to read
it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Ellen took it, blushing. Her heart sank a little. She thought to
herself that he probably did not like it. She looked at him proudly
and timidly, like a child half holding, half withdrawing its hand for
a sweet. It suddenly came to her that she would rather this young man
would praise her valedictory than any one else, that if he had been
present when she read it in the hall, and she had seen him standing
applauding, she could not have contained her triumph and pride. She
was not yet in love with him, but she began to feel that in his
approbation lay the best coin of her realm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very well written, Miss Brewster,&rdquo; said Robert,
and she flushed with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But the young man was looking at her as if he had something
besides praise in mind, and she gazed at him, shrinking a little as
before a blow whose motion she felt in the air. However, he laughed
pleasantly when he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she inquired, vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all that you say in your essay. Do you really believe
that all the property in the world ought to be divided, that kings
and peasants ought to share and share alike?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with round eyes. &ldquo;Why, of course I
do!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert laughed. He had no mind to enter into an argument with this
beautiful girl, nor even to express himself forcibly on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there are a number of things to be considered,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;And do you really believe that employer and
employ&eacute;s should share alike?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Her blue eyes flashed, she tossed her head. Robert smiled at
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Don't the men earn the
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, not exactly,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;There is
the capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The profit comes from the labor, not from the
capital,&rdquo; said Ellen, quickly. &ldquo;Doesn't it?&rdquo; she
continued, with fervor, and yet there was a charming timidity, as
before some authority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; replied Robert, guardedly; &ldquo;but the
question is how far we should go back before we stop in searching for
causes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far back ought we to go?&rdquo; asked Ellen,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess I don't know,&rdquo; said Robert, laughingly.
&ldquo;I have thought very little about it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will have to, if you are to be the head of
Lloyd's,&rdquo; Ellen said, with a severe accent, with grave, blue
eyes full on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not the head of Lloyd's yet,&rdquo; he answered,
easily. &ldquo;My uncle is far from his dotage. Then, too, you know
that I was never intended for a business man, but a lawyer, like my
father, if there had not been so little for my father's second wife
and the children&mdash;&rdquo;  He stopped himself abruptly on the
verge of a confidence. &ldquo;I think I saw you on your way to the
photographer to-day,&rdquo; he said, and Ellen blushed, remembering
her aunt Eva's violent nudge, and wondering if he had noticed. She
gave him a piteous glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All the girls have their
pictures taken in their graduating dresses with their
flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You looked to me as if the picture would be a great
success,&rdquo; said Robert. He longed to ask for one and yet did
not, for a reason unexplained to himself. He knew that this innocent,
unsophisticated creature would see no reason on earth why he should
not ask, and no reason why she should not grant, and on that account
he felt prohibited. That night, after he had gone, Ellen wondered why
he had not asked for one of her pictures, and felt anxious lest he
should have seen the nudge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;if he finds any
fault with anything that my mother has done, I don't want him to have
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert stayed a long time. He kept thinking that he ought to go,
and also that he was bored, and yet he felt a singular unwillingness
to leave, possibly because of his sense that the visit was in a
measure forbidden by prudence. The longer he remained, the prettier
Ellen looked to him. New beauties of line and color seemed to grow
apparent in the soft glow from the hideous lamp. There was a
wonderful starry radiance in her eyes now and then, and when she
turned her head her eyeballs gleamed crimson and her hair seemed to
toss into flame. When she spoke, he was conscious of unknown depths
of sweetness in her voice, and it was so with her smile and her every
motion. There was about the girl a mystery, not of darkness but of
light, which seemed to draw him on and on and on without volition.
And yet she said nothing especially remarkable, for Ellen was only a
young girl, reared in a little provincial city in common
environments. She would have been a great genius had she more than
begun to glimpse the breadth and freedom of the outer world through
her paling of life. She was too young and too unquestioning of what
she had learned from her early loves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you always lived here in Rowe?&rdquo; asked Lloyd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I was born here, and I have
lived here ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have never been away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only once. Once I went to Dragon Beach and stayed a
fortnight with mother.&rdquo;  She said this with a visible sense of
its importance. Dragon Beach was some ten miles from Rowe, a cheap
seashore place, built up with flimsy summer cottages of factory
hands. Andrew had hired one for a fortnight once when Ellen was
ailing, and it had been the event of a lifetime to the family. They
hereafter dated from the year &ldquo;we went to Dragon
Beach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lloyd looked with a quick impulse of compassionate tenderness at
this child who had been away from Rowe once to Dragon Beach. He had
his own impressions of Dragon Beach and also of Rowe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you enjoyed that?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much. The sea is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, after all, it was the sea which she had cared for at Dragon
Beach, and not the clam-bakes and merry-go-rounds and women in
wrappers in the surf. Robert felt rebuked for thinking of anything
but the sea in his memory of Dragon Beach; there was a wonderful
water-view there.</p>

<p>All the time they sat there in the parlor, the murmur of
conversation at the south door continued, and now and again over it
swelled the fervid exhortations of Nahum Beals. Not a word could be
distinguished, but the meaning was beyond doubt. That voice was full
of denunciation, of frenzied appeal, of warning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked Lloyd, after an unusually loud
burst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Beals,&rdquo; replied Ellen, uneasily. She wished that
he would not talk so loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sounds as if he were preaching fire and
brimstone,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he is talking about the labor question,&rdquo; replied
Ellen.</p>

<p>Then she looked confused, for she remembered that this young man's
uncle was the head of Lloyd's, that he himself would be the head of
Lloyd's some day. All at once, along with another feeling which
seemed about to conquer her, came a resentment against this young man
with his fine clothes and his gentle manners. Two men passed the
windows and one of them looked in, and when the electric-light
flashed on his face she saw Granville Joy, and the man with him was
in his shirt-sleeves. She saw those white shirt-sleeves swing into
the darkness, and felt at once antagonized against herself and
against Robert, and yet she knew that she had never seen a man like
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he has settled it,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sounds dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. He is a good man. He wouldn't hurt anybody. He has
always talked that way. He used to come here and talk when I was a
child. It used to frighten me at first, but it doesn't now. It is
only the way that poor people are treated that frightens
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Robert had a sensation of moving unobtrusively aside from a
direct encounter. He looked across the room and started at something
which he espied for the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;but I am
interested in dolls. I see you still keep your doll, Miss
Brewster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen sat stupefied. All at once it dawned upon her what might
happen. In the corner of the parlor sat her beloved doll, still
beloved, though the mother and not the doll had outgrown her first
condition of love. The doll, in the identical dress in which she had
come from Cynthia's so many years ago, sat staring forth with the
fixed radiance of her kind, seated stiffly in a tiny rocking-chair,
also one of the treasures of Ellen's childhood. It was a curious
feature for the best parlor, but Ellen had insisted upon it.
&ldquo;She isn't going to be put away up garret because I have
outgrown her,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;She's going to sit in the
parlor as long as she lives. Suppose I outgrew you, and put you up in
the garret; you wouldn't like it, would you, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a queer child,&rdquo; Fanny had said, laughing, but
she had yielded.</p>

<p>When young Lloyd went close to examine the doll, Ellen's heart
stood still. Suppose he should recognize it? She tried to tell
herself that it was impossible. Could any young man recognize a doll
after all those years? How much did a boy ever care for a doll,
anyway? Not enough to think of it twice after he had given it up. It
was different with a girl. Her doll meant&mdash;God only knew what
her doll meant to her; perhaps it had a meaning of all humanity. But
the boy, what had he cared for the doll? He had gone away out West
and left it.</p>

<p>But Lloyd remembered. He stared down at the doll a moment. Then he
took her up gingerly in her fluffy pink robes of an obsolete fashion.
He held her at arm's length, and stared and stared. Suddenly he
parted the flaxen wig and examined a place on the head. Then he
looked at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is my old doll,&rdquo; he cried, with a great laugh
of wonder and incredulity. &ldquo;Yes, it is my old doll! How in the
world did you come by my doll, Miss Brewster? Account for yourself.
Are you a child kidnapper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen, who had risen and come forward, stood before him,
absolutely still, and very pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is my doll,&rdquo; said Lloyd, with another laugh.
&ldquo;I will tell you how I know. Of course I can tell her face.
Dolls look a good deal alike, I suppose, but I tell you I loved this
doll, and I remember her face, and that little cast in her left eye,
and that beautiful, serene smile; but there's something besides. Once
I burned her head with the red-hot end of the poker to see if she
would wake up. I always had a notion when I was a child that it was
only a question of violence to make her wake up and demonstrate some
existence besides that eternal grin. So I burned her, but it made no
difference; but here is the mark now&mdash;see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen saw. She had often kissed it, but she made no reply. She was
occupied with considerations of the consequences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come by her, if you don't mind telling?&rdquo;
said the young man again. &ldquo;It is the most curious thing for me
to find my old doll sitting here. Of course Aunt Cynthia gave her to
you, but I didn't know that she was acquainted with you. I suppose
she saw a pretty little girl getting around without a doll after I
had gone, and sent her, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly between the young man's face and the girl's flashed a
look of intelligence. Suddenly Robert remembered all that he had
heard of Ellen's childish escapade. He <em>knew</em>. He looked from
her to the doll, and back again. &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he said.
Then he set the doll down in her little chair all of a heap, and
caught Ellen's hand, and shook it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a trump, that is what you are,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;a trump. So she&mdash;&rdquo;  He shook his head, and looked
at Ellen, dazedly. She did not say a word, but looked at him with her
lips closed tightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better for you not to tell me anything,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;I don't want to know. I don't understand, and I never
want to, how it all happened, but I do understand that you are a
trump. How old were you?&rdquo;  Robert's voice took on a tone of
tenderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight,&rdquo; replied Ellen, faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a baby,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;and you
never told! I would like to know where there is another baby who
would do such a thing.&rdquo;  He caught her hand and shook it again.
&ldquo;She was like a mother to me,&rdquo; he said, in a husky voice.
&ldquo;I think a good deal of her. I thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly to the young man looking at the girl a conviction as of
some subtle spiritual perfume came; he had seen her beauty before, he
had realized her charm, but this was something different. A boundless
approbation and approval which was infinitely more precious than
admiration seized him. Her character began to reveal itself, to come
in contact with his own; he felt the warmth of it through the veil of
flesh. He felt a sense of reliance as upon an inexhaustibility of
goodness in another soul. He felt something which was more than love,
being purely unselfish, with as yet no desire of possession.
&ldquo;Here is a good, true woman,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;Here is a good, true woman, who has blossomed from a good,
true child.&rdquo;  He saw a wonderful faithfulness shining in her
blue eyes, he saw truth itself on her lips, and could have gone down
at the feet of the little girl in the pink cotton frock. Going home
he tried to laugh at himself, but could not succeed. It is easy to
shake off the clasp of a hand of flesh, but not the clasp of another
soul.</p>

<p>Ellen on her part was at once overwhelmed with delight and
confusion. She felt the fervor of admiration in the young man's
attitude towards her, but she was painfully conscious of her
undeservingness. She had always felt guilty about her silence and
disobedience towards her parents, and as for any self-approbation for
it, that had been the farthest from her thoughts. She murmured
something deprecatingly, but Lloyd cut her short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no use crying off,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you are one
girl in a thousand, and I thank you, I thank you from the bottom of
my heart. It might have made awful trouble. My aunt Lizzie told me
what a commotion there was over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ran away,&rdquo; said Ellen, anxiously. Suddenly it
occurred to her he might think Cynthia worse than she had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Lloyd&mdash;&ldquo;never mind. I
know what you did. You held your blessed little tongue to save
somebody else, and let yourself be blamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door which led into the sitting-room opened, and Andrew looked
in.</p>

<p>He made a shy motion when he saw Lloyd; still, he came forward.
His own callers had gone, and he had heard voices in the parlor, and
had feared Granville Joy was calling upon Ellen.</p>

<p>As he came forward, Ellen introduced him shyly. &ldquo;This is Mr.
Lloyd, father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Lloyd, this is my
father.&rdquo;  Then she added, &ldquo;He came to bring back my
valedictory.&rdquo;  She was very awkward, but it was the charming
awkwardness of a beautiful child. She looked exceedingly childish
standing beside her father, looking into his worn, embarrassed
face.</p>

<p>Lloyd shook hands with Andrew, and said something about the
valedictory, which he had enjoyed reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wrote it all herself without a bit of help from the
teacher,&rdquo; said Andrew, with wistful pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is remarkably well written,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn't hear it read at the hall?&rdquo; said
Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I had not that good fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have heard them clap,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; murmured Ellen, but she looked
innocently at her father as if she delighted in his pride and
pleasure without a personal consideration.</p>

<p>The front door opened. &ldquo;That's your mother,&rdquo; said
Andrew.</p>

<p>Fanny looked into the lighted parlor, and dodged back with a
little giggle.</p>

<p>Ellen colored painfully. &ldquo;It is Mr. Lloyd, mother,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>Then Fanny came forward and shook hands with Robert. Her face was
flaming&mdash;she cast involuntary glances at Andrew for confirmation
of her opinion. She was openly and shamelessly triumphant, and yet
all at once Robert ceased to be repelled by it. Through his insight
into the girl's character, he had seemed to gain suddenly a clearer
vision for the depths of human love and pity which are beneath the
coarse and the common. When Fanny stood beside her daughter and
looked at her, then at Robert, with the reflection of the beautiful
young face in her eyes of love, she became at once pathetic and
sacred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all natural,&rdquo; he said to himself as he was
going home.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XX</h3>

<p>Robert Lloyd when he came to Rowe was confronted with one of the
hardest tasks in the world, that of adjustment to circumstances which
had hitherto been out of his imagination. He had not dreamed of a
business life in connection with himself. Though he had always had a
certain admiration for his successful uncle, Norman Lloyd, yet he had
always had along with the admiration a recollection of the old tale
of the birthright and the mess of pottage. He had expected to follow
the law, like his father, but when he had finished college, about two
years after his father's death, he had to face the unexpected. The
stocks in which the greater part of the elder Lloyd's money had been
invested had depreciated; some of them were for the time being quite
worthless as far as income was concerned. There were two little
children&mdash;girls&mdash;by his father's second marriage, and there
was not enough to support them and their mother and allow Robert to
continue his reading for the law. So he pursued, without the
slightest hesitation, but with bitter regret, the only course which
he saw open before him. He wrote to his uncle Norman, and was
welcomed to a position in his factory with more warmth than he had
ever seen displayed by him. In fact, Norman Lloyd, who had no son of
his own, saw with a quickening of his pulses the handsome young
fellow of his own race who had in a measure thrown himself upon his
protection. He had never shared his wife's longing for children as
children, and had never cared for Robert when a child; but now, when
he was a man grown and bore his name, he appealed to him.</p>

<p>Norman Lloyd was supposed to be heaping up riches, and wild
stories of his wealth were told in Rowe. He gave large sums to public
benefactions, and never stinted his wife in her giving within certain
limits. It would have puzzled any one when faced with facts to
understand why he had the name of a hard man, but he had it, whether
justly or not. &ldquo;He's as hard as nails,&rdquo; people said. His
employ&eacute;s hated him&mdash;that is, the more turbulent and
undisciplined spirits hated him, and the others regarded him as
slaves might a stern master. When Robert started his work in his
uncle's office he started handicapped by this sentiment towards his
uncle. He looked like his uncle, he talked like him, he had his same
gentle stiffness, he was never unduly familiar. He was at once placed
in the same category by the workmen.</p>

<p>Robert Lloyd did not concern himself in the least as to what the
employ&eacute;s in his uncle's factory thought of him. Nothing was
more completely out of his mind. He was conscious of standing on a
firm base of philanthropic principle, and if ever these men came
directly under his control, he was resolved to do his duty by them so
far as in him lay.</p>

<p><br>Ellen, since her graduation, had been like an animal which
circles about in its endeavors to find its best and natural place of
settlement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do next?&rdquo; she had said to her mother.
&ldquo;Shall I go to work, or shall I try to find a school somewhere
in the fall, or shall I stay here, and help you with some work I can
do at home? I know father cannot afford to support me always at
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he can afford to support his only daughter at home
a little while after she has just got out of school,&rdquo; Fanny had
returned indignantly, with a keen pain at her heart.</p>

<p>Fanny mentioned this conversation to Andrew that night after Ellen
had gone to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think&mdash;Ellen was asking me this afternoon
what she had better do!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What she had better do?&rdquo; repeated Andrew, vaguely. He
looked shrinkingly at Fanny, who seemed to him to have an accusing
air, as if in some way he were to blame for something. And, indeed,
there were times when Fanny in those days did blame Andrew, but there
was some excuse for her. She blamed him when her own back was filling
her very soul with the weariness of its ache as she bent over the
seams of those grinding wrappers, and when her heart was sore over
doubt of Ellen's future. At those times she acknowledged to herself
that it seemed to her that Andrew somehow might have gotten on
better. She did not know how, but somehow. He had not had an
expensive family. &ldquo;Why had he not succeeded?&rdquo; she asked
herself. So there was in her tone an unconscious recrimination when
she answered his question about Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;what she had better go to work at,&rdquo; said
Fanny, dryly, her black eyes cold on her husband's face.</p>

<p>Andrew turned so white that he frightened her. &ldquo;Go to
work!&rdquo; said he. Then all at once he gave an exceedingly loud
and bitter groan. It betrayed all his pride in and ambition for his
daughter and his disgust and disappointment over himself. &ldquo;Oh!
my God, has it come to this,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;that I cannot
support my one child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny laid down her work and looked at him. &ldquo;Now,
Andrew,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there's no use in your taking it
after such a fashion as this. I told Ellen that it was all
nonsense&mdash;that she could stay at home and rest this
summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess, if she can't&mdash;&rdquo; said Andrew. He dropped
his gray head into his hands, and began to sob dryly. Fanny, after
staring at him a moment, tossed her work onto the floor, went over to
him, and drew his head to her shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, old man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;ain't you ashamed
of yourself? I told her there was no need for her to worry at
present. Don't do so, Andrew; you've done the best you could, and I
know it, if I stop to think, though I do seem sort of impatient
sometimes. You've always worked hard and done your best. It ain't
your fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know whether it is or not,&rdquo; said Andrew, in a
high, querulous voice like a woman's. &ldquo;It seems as if it must
be somebody's fault. If it ain't my fault, whose is it? You can't
blame the Almighty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it ain't anybody's fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be. All that goes wrong is somebody's fault. It
can't be that it just happens&mdash;that would be worse than the
other. It is better to have a God that is cruel than one that don't
care, and it is better to be to blame yourself, and have it your
fault, than His. Somehow, I have been to blame, Fanny. I must have.
It would have been enough sight better for you, Fanny, if you'd
married another man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't want another man,&rdquo; replied Fanny, half
angrily, half tenderly. &ldquo;You make me all out of patience,
Andrew Brewster. What's the need of Ellen going to work right away?
Maybe by-and-by she can get an easy school. Then, we've got that
money in the bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew looked away from her with his face set. Fanny did not know
yet about his withdrawal of the money for the purpose of investing in
mining-stocks. He never looked at her but the guilty secret seemed to
force itself between them like a wedge of ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Grandma Brewster has got a little something,&rdquo;
said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only just enough for herself,&rdquo; said Andrew. Then he
added, fiercely, &ldquo;Mother can't be stinted of her little
comforts even for Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'ain't never wanted to stint your mother of her
comforts,&rdquo; Fanny retorted, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She 'ain't got but a precious little, unless she spends her
principal,&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;She 'ain't got more'n a hundred
and fifty or so a year clear after her taxes and insurance are
paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't saying anything,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;But I do
say you're dreadful foolish to take on so when you've got so much to
fall back on, and that money in the bank. Here you haven't had to
touch the interest for quite a while and it has been
accumulating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was agreed between the two that Ellen must say nothing to her
grandmother Brewster about going to work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the old lady would have a fit if she thought
Ellen was going to work,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;She 'ain't never
thought she ought to lift her finger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Ellen was charged on no account to say anything to her
grandmother about the possible necessity of her going to work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother's awful proud,&rdquo; said Fanny,
&ldquo;and she's always thought you were too good to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think anybody is too good to work,&rdquo; replied
Ellen, but she uttered the platitude with a sort of mental
reservation. In spite of herself, the attitude of worship in which
she had always seen all who belonged to her had spoiled her a little.
She did look at herself with a sort of compunction when she realized
the fact that she might have to go to work in the shop some time.
School-teaching was different, but could she earn enough
school-teaching? There was a sturdy vein in the girl. All the time
she pitied herself she blamed herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come of working-people, Ellen Brewster. Why are you any
better than they? Why are your hands any better than their hands,
your brain than theirs? Why are you any better than the other girls
who have gone to work in the shops? Do you think you are any better
than Abby Atkins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And still Ellen used to look at herself with a pitying conviction
that she would be out of place at a bench in the shoe-factory, that
she would suffer a certain indignity by such a course. The
realization of a better birthright was strong upon her, although she
chided herself for it. And everybody abetted her in it. When she said
once to Abby Atkins, whom she encountered one day going home from the
shop, that she wondered if she could get a job in her room in the
fall, Abby turned upon her fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Ellen Brewster, you ain't going to work in a
shoe-shop?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see why not as well as you,&rdquo; returned
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; repeated the other girl. &ldquo;Look at
yourself, and look at us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, Ellen saw projected upon her mental vision herself
passing down the street with the throng of factory operatives which
her bodily eyes actually witnessed. She had come opposite Lloyd's as
the six o'clock whistle was blowing. She saw herself in her clean,
light summer frock, slight and dainty, with little hands like white
flowers in the blue folds of her skirt, with her fine, sensitive
outlook of fair face, and her dainty carriage; and she saw
others&mdash;those girls and women in dingy skirts and bagging
blouses, with coarse hair strained into hard knots of exigency from
patient, or sullen faces, according to their methods of bearing their
lots; all of them rank with the smell of leather, their coarse hands
stained with it, swinging their poor little worn bags which had held
their dinners. There were not many foreigners among them, except the
Irish, most of whom had been born in this country, and a sprinkling
of fair-haired, ruddy Swedes and keen Polanders, who bore themselves
better than the Americans, being not so apparently at odds with the
situation.</p>

<p>The factory employ&eacute;s in Rowe were a superior lot, men and
women. Many of the men had put on their worn coats when they emerged
from the factory, and their little bags were supposed to disguise the
fact of their being dinner satchels. And yet there was a difference
between Ellen Brewster and the people among whom she walked, and she
felt it with a sort of pride and indignation with herself that it was
so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see why I should be any better than the
rest,&rdquo; said she, defiantly, to Abby Atkins. &ldquo;My father
works in a shop, and you are my best friend, and you do. Why
shouldn't I work in a shop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at yourself,&rdquo; repeated the other girl,
mercilessly. &ldquo;You are different. You ain't to blame for it any
more than a flower is to blame for being a rose and not a common
burdock. If you've got to do anything, you had better teach
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather teach school,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;but
I couldn't earn so much unless I got more education and got a higher
position than a district school, and that is out of the
question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe your grandmother could send you,&rdquo;
said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, grandma can't afford to. Sometimes I think I could
work my own way through college, if it wasn't for being a burden in
the mean time, but I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Abby Atkins planted herself on the sidewalk in front of
Ellen, and looked at her sharply, while an angry flush overspread her
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know one thing,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't true what I heard the other day, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what you heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I heard you were going to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen turned quite pale, and looked at the other girl with a
steady regard of grave, indignant blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don't be mad, Ellen. I heard real straight that you
were going to marry Granville Joy in the fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not,&rdquo; repeated Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't suppose you were, but I knew he had always wanted
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always wanted me!&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;Why, he's only
just out of school!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that, and he's only just gone to work, and he
can't be earning much, but I heard it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stream of factory operatives had thinned; many had taken the
trolley-cars, and others had gone to the opposite side of the street,
which was shady. The two girls were alone, standing before a vacant
lot grown to weeds, rank bristles of burdock, and slender spikes of
evanescent succory. Abby burst out in a passionate appeal, clutching
Ellen's arm hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, promise me you never will,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise you what, Abby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, promise me you never will marry anybody like him. I
know it's none of my business&mdash;I know that is something that is
none of anybody's business, no matter how much they think of anybody;
but I think more of you than any man ever will, I don't care who he
is. I know I do, Ellen Brewster. And don't you ever marry a man like
Granville Joy, just an ordinary man who works in the shop, and will
never do anything but work in the shop. I know he's good, real good
and steady, and it ain't against him that he ain't rich and has to
work for his living, but I tell you, Ellen Brewster, you ain't the
right sort to marry a man like that, and have a lot of children to
work in shops. No man, if he thinks anything of you, ought to ask you
to; but all a man thinks of is himself. Granville Joy, or any other
man who wanted you, would take you and spoil you, and think he'd done
a smart thing.&rdquo;  Abby spoke with such intensity that it
redeemed her from coarseness. Ellen continued to look at her, and two
red spots had come on her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe I'll ever get married at all,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you've got to get married, you ought to marry somebody
like young Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>Then Ellen blushed, and pushed past her indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Mr. Lloyd!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I don't want him,
and he doesn't want me. I wish you wouldn't talk so, Abby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would want you if your were a rich girl, and your father
was boss instead of a workman,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>Then she caught hold of Ellen's arm and pressed her own thin one
in its dark-blue cotton sleeve lovingly against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain't mad with me, are you, Ellen?&rdquo; she said,
with that indescribable gentleness tempering her fierceness of nature
which gave her caresses the fascination of some little, untamed
animal. Ellen pressed her round young arm tenderly against the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think more of you than any man I know,&rdquo; said she,
fervently. &ldquo;I think more of you than anybody except father and
mother, Abby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls walked on with locked arms, and each was possessed
with that wholly artless and ignorant passion often seen between two
young girls. Abby felt Ellen's warm round arm against hers with a
throbbing of rapture, and glanced at her fair face with adoration.
She held her in a sort of worship, she loved her so that she was
fairly afraid of her. As for Ellen, Abby's little, leather-stained,
leather-scented figure, strung with passion like a bundle of electric
wire, pressing against her, seemed to inform her farthest
thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I live longer than my father and mother, we'll live
together, Abby,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I'll work for you, Ellen,&rdquo; said Abby,
rapturously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you won't do all the work,&rdquo; said Ellen. She
gazed tenderly into Abby's little, dark, thin face. &ldquo;You're all
worn out with work now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and there you bought
that beautiful pin for me with your hard earnings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it had been a great deal better,&rdquo; said Abby,
fervently.</p>

<p>She had given Ellen a gold brooch for a graduating-gift, and had
paid a week's wages for it, and gone without her new dress, and
stayed away from the graduation, but that last Ellen never knew; Abby
had told her that she was sick.</p>

<p><br>That evening Robert Lloyd and his aunt Cynthia Lennox called
on the Brewsters. Ellen was under the trees in the west yard when she
heard a carriage stop in front of the house and saw the sitting-room
lamp travel through the front entry to the front door. She wondered
indifferently who it was. Carriages were not given to stopping at
their house of an evening; then she reflected that it might be some
one to get her mother to do some sewing, and remained still.</p>

<p>It was a bright moonlight night; the whole yard was a lovely
dapple of lights and shadows. Ellen had a vivid perception of the
beauty of it all, and also that unrest and yearning which comes often
to a young girl in moonlight. This beauty and strangeness of familiar
scenes under the silver glamour of the moon gave her, as it were, an
assurance of other delights and beauties of life besides those which
she already knew, and along with the assurance came that wild
yearning. Ellen seemed to scent her honey of life, and at the same
time the hunger for it leaped to her consciousness. She had begun by
thinking of what Abby had said to her that afternoon, and then the
train of thought led her on and on. She quite ignored all about the
sordid ways and means of existence, about toil and privation and
children born to it. All at once the conviction was strong upon her
that love, and love alone, was the chief end and purpose of life, at
once its source and its result, the completion of its golden ring of
glory. Her thought, started in whatever direction, seemed to slide
always into that one all-comprehending circle&mdash;she could not get
her imagination away from it. She began to realize that the mind of
mortal man could not get away from the law which produced it. She
began to understand dimly, as one begins to understand any great
truth, that everything around her obeyed that unwritten fundamental
law of love, expressed it, sounded it, down to the leaves of the
trees casting their flickering shadows on the silver field of
moonlight, and the long-drawn chorus of the insects of the summer
night. She thought of Abby and how much she loved her; then that love
seemed the step which gave her an impetus to another love. She began
to remember Granville Joy, how he had kissed her that night over the
fence and twice since, how he had walked home with her from
entertainments, how he had looked at her. She saw the boy's face and
his look as plain as if he stood before her, and her heart leaped
with a shock of pain which was joy.</p>

<p>Then she thought of Robert Lloyd, and his face came before her.
Ellen had not thought as much of Robert as he of her. For some two
weeks after his call she had watched for him to come again; she had
put on a pretty dress and been particular about her hair, and had
stayed at home expecting him; then when he had not come, she had put
him out of mind resolutely. When her mother and aunt had joked her
about him she had been sensitive and half angry. &ldquo;You know it
is nothing, mother,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he only came to bring
back my valedictory. You know he wouldn't think of me. He'll marry
somebody like Maud Hemingway.&rdquo;  Maud Hemingway was the daughter
of the leading physician in Rowe, and regarded with a mixture of
spite and admiration by daughters of the factory operatives. Maud
Hemingway was attending college, and rode a saddle-horse when home on
her vacations. She had been to Europe.</p>

<p>But that evening in the moonlight Ellen began thinking again of
Robert Lloyd. His face came before her as plainly as Granville Joy's.
She had arrived at that stage when life began to be as a
picture-gallery of love. Through this and that face the goddess might
look, and the look was what she sought; as yet, the man was a minor
quantity.</p>

<p>All at once it seemed to Ellen, looking at her mental picture of
young Lloyd, that she could see love in his face yet more plainly,
more according to her conception of it, than in the other. She began
to build an air-castle which had no reference whatever to Robert's
position, and to his being the nephew of the richest factory-owner in
Rowe, and so far as that went he had not a whit the advantage of
Granville Joy in her eyes. But Robert's face wore to her more of the
guise of that for which the night and the moonlight, and her youth,
had made her long. So she began innocently to imagine a meeting with
him at a picnic which would be held some time at Liberty Park. She
imagined their walking side by side, through a lovely dapple of
moonlight like this, and saying things to each other. Then all at
once the man of her dreams touched her hand in a dream, and a
faintness swept over her. Then suddenly, gathering shape out of the
indetermination of the shadows and the moonlight, came a man into the
yard, and Ellen thought with awe and delight that it was he; but
instead Granville Joy stood before her, lifting his hat above his
soft shock of hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; responded Ellen, and Granville Joy
felt abashed. He lay awake half the night reflecting that he should
have greeted her with a &ldquo;Good-evening&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; as he had been used to do in their school-days;
that she was now a young lady, and that Mr. Lloyd had accosted her
differently. Ellen rose with a feeling of disappointment that
Granville was himself, which is the hardest greeting possible for a
guest, involving the most subtle reproach in the world&mdash;the
reproach for a man's own individuality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't get up, Ellen,&rdquo; the young man said,
awkwardly. &ldquo;Here&mdash;I'll sit down here on the rock.&rdquo;
Then he flung himself down on the ledge of rock which cropped out
like a bare rib of the earth between the trees, and Ellen seated
herself again in her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful night, ain't it?&rdquo; said Granville.</p>

<p>Ellen noticed that Granville said &ldquo;ain't&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;isn't,&rdquo; according to the fashion of his own family,
although he was recently graduated from the high-school. Ellen had
separated herself, although with no disparaging reflections, from the
language of her family. She also noticed that Granville presently
said &ldquo;wa'n't&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;wasn't.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hot yesterday, wa'n't it?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was very warm,&rdquo; replied Ellen. That
&ldquo;wa'n't&rdquo; seemed to insert a tiny wedge between them. She
would have flown at any one who had found fault with her father and
mother for saying &ldquo;wa'n't,&rdquo; but with this young man in
her own rank and day it was different. It argued something in him, or
a lack of something. An indignation all out of proportion to the
offence seized her. It seemed to her that he had in this simple
fashion outraged that which was infinitely higher than he himself. He
had not lived up to her thought of him, and fallen short by a little
slip in English which argued a slip in character. She wanted to
reproach him sharply&mdash;to ask him if he had ever been to
school.</p>

<p>He noticed her manner was cool, and was as far as the antipodes
from suspecting the cause. He never knew that he said
&ldquo;ain't&rdquo; and &ldquo;wa'n't,&rdquo; and would die not
knowing. All that he looked at was the substance of thought behind
the speech. And just then he was farther than ever from thinking of
it, for he was single-hearted with Ellen.</p>

<p>The boy crept nearer her on the rock with a shy, nestling motion;
the moonlight shone full on his handsome young face, giving it a
stern quality. &ldquo;Ellen, look at here,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then he stopped. Ellen waited, not dreaming what was to follow.
She had never had a proposal; then, too, he had just been chased out
of her mental perspective by the other man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at here, Ellen,&rdquo; said Granville. He stopped
again; then when he spoke his voice had an indescribably solemn,
beseeching quality. &ldquo;Oh, Ellen,&rdquo; he said, reaching up and
catching her hand. He dragged himself nearer, leaned his cheek
against her hand, which it seemed to burn; then he began kissing it
with soft, pouting lips.</p>

<p>Ellen tried to pull her hand away. &ldquo;Let my hand go this
minute, Granville Joy,&rdquo; she said, angrily.</p>

<p>The boy let her hand go immediately, and stood up, leaning over
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be angry; I didn't mean any harm, Ellen,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be angry if you do such a thing again,&rdquo; said
Ellen. &ldquo;We aren't children; you have no right to do such a
thing, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought maybe you wouldn't mind, Ellen,&rdquo; said
Granville. Then he added, with his voice all husky with emotion and a
kind of fear: &ldquo;Ellen, you know how I feel about you. You know
how I have always felt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen made no reply. It seemed inconceivable that she for the
minute should not know his meaning, but she was bewildered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I've always counted on havin' you for my wife some
day when we were both old enough,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;and
I've gone to work now, and I hope to get bigger pay before long,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen rose with sudden realization. &ldquo;Granville Joy,&rdquo;
cried she, with something like panic in her voice, &ldquo;you must
not! Oh, if I had known! I would not have let you finish. I would
not, Granville.&rdquo;  She caught his arm, and clung to it, and
looked up at him pitifully. &ldquo;You know I wouldn't have let you
finish,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don't be hurt, Granville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy looked at her as if she had struck him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ellen,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Oh, Ellen, I always
thought you would!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not going to marry anybody,&rdquo; said Ellen. Her
voice wavered in spite of herself; the young man's look and voice
were shaking her through weakness of her own nature which she did not
understand, but which might be mightier than her strength. Something
crept into her tone which emboldened the young man to seize her hand
again. &ldquo;You do, in spite of all you say&mdash;&rdquo; he began;
but just then a long shadow fell athwart the moonlight, and Ellen
snatched her hand away imperceptibly, and young Lloyd stood before
them.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXI</h3>

<p>Granville Joy was employed in Lloyd's, and Robert had seen him
that very day and spoken to him, but he did not recognize him, not
until Ellen spoke. &ldquo;This is Mr. Joy, Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;perhaps you know him. He works in your uncle's
shop.&rdquo;  She said it quite simply, as if it was a matter of
course that Robert was on speaking terms with all the employ&eacute;s
in his uncle's factory.</p>

<p>Granville colored. &ldquo;I saw Mr. Lloyd this afternoon in the
cutting-room,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we had some talk together;
but maybe he don't remember, there are so many of us.&rdquo;
Granville said &ldquo;so many of us&rdquo; with an indescribably
bitter emphasis. Suddenly his gentleness seemed changed to gall. It
was the terrible protest of one of the herd who goes along with the
rest, yet realizes it, and looks ever out from his common mass with
fierce eyes of individual dissent at the immutable conditions of
things. Immediately, when Granville saw the other young man, this
gentleman in his light summer clothes, who bore about him no stain
nor odor of toil, he felt that here was Ellen's mate; that he was
left behind. He looked at him, not missing a detail of his
superiority, and he saw himself young and not ill-looking, but
hopelessly common, clad in awkward clothes; he smelled the smell of
leather that steamed up in his face from his raiment and his body;
and he looked at Ellen, fair and white in her dainty muslin, and saw
himself thrust aside, as it were, by his own judgment as to the
fitness of things, but with no less bitterness. When he said
&ldquo;there are so many of us,&rdquo; he felt the impulse of
revolution in his heart; that he would have liked to lead the
&ldquo;many of us&rdquo; against this young aristocrat. But Robert
smiled, though somewhat stiffly, and bowed. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,
Mr. Joy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I do remember, but for a minute I did
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't wonder,&rdquo; said Granville, and again he
repeated, &ldquo;There are so many of us,&rdquo; in that sullen,
bitter tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with the fellow?&rdquo; thought Robert;
but he said, civilly enough; &ldquo;Oh, not at all, Mr. Joy. I will
admit there are a good many of you, as you say, but that would not
prevent my remembering a man to whom I was speaking only a few hours
ago. It was only the half-light, and I did not expect to see you
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Joy is a very old friend of mine,&rdquo; Ellen said,
quickly, with a painful impulse of loyalty. The moment she saw her
old school-boy lover intimidated, and manifestly at a disadvantage
before this elegant young gentleman, she felt a fierce instinct of
partisanship. She stood a little nearer to him. Granville's face
lightened, he looked at her gratefully, and Robert stared from one to
the other doubtfully. He began to wonder if he had interrupted a
love-scene, and was at once pained with a curious, new pain, and
indignant. Then, too, he scarcely knew what to do. He had been sent
to ask Ellen to come into the parlor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My aunt is in the house,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your aunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my aunt, Miss Lennox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen gave a great start, and stared at him. &ldquo;Does she want
to see me?&rdquo; she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>Robert glanced at Granville. He was afraid of being rude towards
this possible lover, but the young man was quick to perceive the
situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I must be going,&rdquo; he said to Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must you hurry?&rdquo; she returned, in the common, polite
rejoinder of her class in Rowe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess I must,&rdquo; said Granville. He held out his
hand towards Ellen, then drew it away, but she extended hers
resolutely, and so forced his back again. &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo;
she said, kindly, almost tenderly, and again Robert thought with that
sinking at his heart that here was quite possibly the girl's lover,
and all his dreams were thrown away.</p>

<p>As for Granville, he glowed with a sudden triumph over the other.
Again he became almost sure that Ellen loved him after all, that it
was only her maiden shyness which had led her to refuse him. He
pressed her hand hard, and held it as long as he dared; then he
turned to Robert. &ldquo;I'll bid you good-evening, sir,&rdquo; he
said, with awkward dignity, and was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go in and see your aunt,&rdquo; Ellen said to
Robert, regarding him as she spoke with a startled expression. It had
flashed through her mind that Miss Lennox had possibly come to
confess the secret of so many years ago, and she shrank with terror
as before the lowering of some storm of spirit. She knew how little
was required to lash her mother's violent nature into fury.
&ldquo;She was not&mdash;?&rdquo; she began to say to Robert, then
she stopped; but he understood. &ldquo;Don't be afraid, Miss
Brewster,&rdquo; he said, kindly. &ldquo;It is not a matter of
by-gones, but the future. My aunt has a plan for you which I think
you will like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked at him wonderingly, but she went with him across the
moonlit yard into the house.</p>

<p>She found Miss Cynthia Lennox, fair and elegant in a filmy black
gown, and a broad black hat draped with lace and violets shading her
delicate, clear-cut face, and her father and mother. Fanny's eyes
were red. She looked as if she had been running&mdash;in fact, one
could easily hear her breathe across the room. &ldquo;Ellen, here is
Miss Lennox,&rdquo; she said. Ellen approached the lady, who rose,
and the two shook hands. &ldquo;Good-evening, Miss Brewster,&rdquo;
said Cynthia, in the same tone which she might have used towards a
society acquaintance. Ellen would never have known that she had heard
the voice before. As she remembered it, it was full of intensest
vibrations of maternal love and tenderness and protection beyond
anything which she had ever heard in her own mother's voice. Now it
was all gone, and also the old look from her eyes. Cynthia Lennox
was, in fact, quite another woman to the young girl from what she had
been to the child. In truth, she cared not one whit for Ellen, but
she was possessed with a stern desire of atonement, and far stronger
than her love was the appreciation of what that mother opposite must
have suffered during that day and night when she had forcibly kept
her treasure. The agony of that she could present to her
consciousness very vividly, but she could not awaken the old love
which had been the baby's for this young girl. Cynthia felt much more
affection for Fanny than for Ellen. When she had unfolded her plan
for sending Ellen to college, and Fanny had almost gone hysterical
with delight, she found it almost impossible to keep her tears back.
She knew so acutely how this other woman felt that she almost seemed
to lose her own individuality. She began to be filled with a
vicarious adoration of Ellen, which was, however, dissipated the
moment she actually saw her. She realized that this grown-up girl,
who could no longer be cuddled and cradled, was nothing to her, but
her sympathy with the mother remained.</p>

<p>Ellen remained standing after she had greeted Cynthia. Robert went
over to the mantle-piece and stood leaning against it. He was
completely puzzled and disturbed by the whole affair. Ellen looked at
Cynthia, then at her parents. &ldquo;Ellen, come here, child,&rdquo;
said her father, suddenly, and Ellen went over to him, sitting on the
plush sofa beside her mother.</p>

<p>Andrew reached up and took hold of Ellen's hands, and drew her
down on his knee as if she had been a child. &ldquo;Ellen, look
here,&rdquo; he said, in an intense, almost solemn voice,
&ldquo;father has got something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny began to weep almost aloud. Cynthia looked straight ahead,
keeping her features still with an effort. Robert studied the carpet
pattern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ellen,&rdquo; said Andrew; &ldquo;you know that
father has always wanted to do everything for you, but he ain't able
to do all he would like to. God hasn't prospered him, and it seems
likely that he won't be able to do any more than he has done, if so
much, in the years to come. You know father has always wanted to send
you to college, and give you an extra education so you could teach in
a school where you would make a good living, and now here Miss Lennox
says she heard your composition, and she has heard a good deal about
you from Mr. Harris, how well you stood in the high-school, and she
says she is willing to send you to Vassar College.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen turned pale. She looked long at her father, whose pathetic,
worn, half-triumphant, half-pitiful face was so near her own; then
she looked at Cynthia, then back again. &ldquo;To Vassar
College?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ellen, to Vassar College, and she offers to clothe you
while you are there, but we thank her, and tell her that ain't
necessary. We can furnish your clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can,&rdquo; said Fanny, in a sobbing voice, but
with a flash of pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say to it, Ellen?&rdquo; asked Andrew,
and he asked it with the expression of a martyr. At that moment
indescribable pain was the uppermost sensation in his heart, over all
his triumph and gladness for Ellen. First came the anticipated agony
of parting with her for the greater part of four years, then the pain
of letting another do for his daughter what he wished to do himself.
No man would ever look in Ellen's eyes with greater love and greater
shrinking from the pain which might come of love than Andrew at that
moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Ellen; then she stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you spare me for so long? Ought I not to be earning
money before that, if you don't have much work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we can spare you as far as all that goes,&rdquo;
cried Andrew. &ldquo;I guess we can. I guess we don't want you to
support us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather guess we don't,&rdquo; cried Fanny.</p>

<p>Ellen looked at her father a moment longer with an adorable look,
which Robert saw with a sidewise glance of his downcast eyes, then at
her mother. Then she slid from her father's knee and crossed the room
and stood before Cynthia. &ldquo;I don't know how to thank you
enough,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I thank you very much, and not
only for myself but for them&rdquo;; she made a slight, graceful,
backward motion of her shoulder towards her parents. &ldquo;I will
study hard and try to do you credit,&rdquo; said she. There was
something about Ellen's direct, childlike way of looking at her, and
her clear speech, which brought back to Cynthia the little girl of so
many years ago. A warm flush came over her delicate cheeks; her eyes
grew bright with tenderness.</p>

<div align="center">
<a href="images/plimage6.jpg">
<img src="images/plimage6.jpg" width="450" height="617"
alt="I'll study hard and try to do you credit"></a>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt as to your doing your best, my dear,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and it gives me great pleasure to do this for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, said with a graceful softness which was charming, she
made as if to rise, but Ellen still stood before her. She had
something more to say. &ldquo;If ever I am able,&rdquo; she
said&mdash;&ldquo;and I shall be able some day if I have my
health&mdash;I will repay you.&rdquo;  Ellen spoke with the greatest
sweetness, yet with an inflexibility of pride evident in her face.
Cynthia smiled. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you feel
better to leave it in that way. If ever you are able you shall repay
me; in the mean time I consider that I am amply paid in the pleasure
it gives me to do it.&rdquo;  Cynthia held out her slender hand to
Ellen, who took it gratefully, yet a little constrainedly.</p>

<p>In the opposite corner the doll sat staring at them with eyes of
blank blue and her vacuous smile. A vague sense of injury was over
Ellen, in spite of her delight and her gratitude&mdash;a sense of
injury which she could not fathom, and for which she chided herself.
However, Andrew felt it also.</p>

<p>After this surprising benefactress and Robert had gone, after
repeated courtesies and assurances of obligation on both sides,
Andrew turned to Fanny. &ldquo;What does she do it for?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush; she'll hear you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't help it. What does she do it for? Ellen isn't
anything to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny looked at him with a meaning smile and nod which made her
tear-stained face fairly grotesque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean lookin' that way?&rdquo; demanded
Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you wait and see,&rdquo; said Fanny, with meaning, and
would say no more. She was firm in her conclusion that Cynthia was
educating their girl to marry her favorite nephew, but that never
occurred to Andrew. He continued to feel, while supremely grateful
and overwhelmed with delight at this good fortune for Ellen, the
distrust and resentment of a proud soul under obligation for which he
sees no adequate reason, and especially when it is directed towards a
beloved one to whom he would fain give of his own strength and
treasure.</p>

<p>As for Ellen, she was in a tumult of wonder and delight, but when
she looked at the doll in her corner there came again that vague
sense of injury, and she felt again as if in some way she were being
robbed instead of being made the object of benefit.</p>

<p>After Ellen had gone to bed that night she wondered if she ought
to go to college, and maybe gain thereby a career which was beyond
anything her own loved ones had known, and if it were not better for
her to go to work in the shop after all.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXII</h3>

<p>When Mrs. Zelotes was made acquainted with the plan for sending
Ellen to Vassar she astonished Fanny. Fanny ran over the next
morning, after Andrew had gone to work, to tell her mother-in-law.
She sat a few minutes in the sitting-room, where the old lady was
knitting, before she unfolded the burden of her errand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cynthia Lennox came to our house last night with Robert
Lloyd,&rdquo; she said, finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they?&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Zelotes, who had known
perfectly well that they had come, having recognized the Lennox
carriage in the moonlight, and having been ever since devoured with
curiosity, which she would have died rather than betray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they did,&rdquo; said Fanny. Then she added, after a
pause which gave wonderful impressiveness to the news, &ldquo;Cynthia
Lennox wants to send Ellen to college&mdash;to Vassar
College.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she jumped, for the old woman seemed to spring at her like
released wire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send her to college!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What does she
want to send her to college for? What right has Cynthia Lennox got to
send Ellen Brewster anywhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny stared at her dazedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right has she got interfering?&rdquo; demanded Mrs.
Zelotes again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Fanny, stammering, &ldquo;she thought
Ellen was so smart. She heard her valedictory, and the school-teacher
had talked about her, what a good scholar she was, and she thought it
would be nice for her to go to college, and she should be very much
obliged herself, and feel that we were granting her a great pleasure
and privilege if we allowed her to send Ellen to Vassar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All unconsciously Fanny imitated to the life Cynthia's soft
elegance of speech and language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes; but still she said it not
so much angrily as doubtfully. &ldquo;It's the first time I ever
heard of Cynthia Lennox doing such a thing as that,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I never knew she was given to sending girls to college. I
never heard of her giving anything to anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny looked mysteriously at her mother-in-law with sudden
confidence. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women looked at each other, and neither said a word, but
the meaning of one flashed to the other like telegraphy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you s'pose that's it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, her old
face relaxing into half-shamed, half-pleased smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Fanny, emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I 'ain't a doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did act as if he couldn't take his eyes off her at the
exhibition,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Zelotes, reflectively; &ldquo;mebbe
you're right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I'm right just as well as if I'd seen it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mebbe you are. What does Andrew say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he wishes he was the one to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he does&mdash;he's a Brewster,&rdquo; said his
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he's got sense enough to be pleased that Ellen has got
the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain't any more pleased than I be at anything that's a
good chance for Ellen,&rdquo; said the grandmother; but all the same,
after Fanny had gone, her joy had a sharp sting for her. She was not
one who could take a gift to heart without feeling its sharp
edge.</p>

<p>Had Ellen's sentiment been analyzed, she felt in something the
same way that her grandmother did. However, she had begun to dream
definitely about Robert, and the reflection had come, too, that this
might make her more his equal, as nearly his equal as Maud
Hemingway.</p>

<p>Maud Hemingway went to college, and so would she. Of the minor
accessories of wealth she thought not so much. She looked at her
hands, which were very small and as delicately white as flowers, and
reflected with a sense of comfort, of which she was ashamed, that she
would not need ever to stain them with leather now. She looked at the
homeward stream of dingy girls from the shops, and thought with a
sense of escape that she would never have to join them; but she was
conscious of loving Abby better, and Maria, who had also entered
Lloyd's. Abby, when she heard the news about Vassar, had looked at
her with a sort of fierce exultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord, you're out of it, anyhow!&rdquo; she cried,
fervently, as a soul might in the midst of flames.</p>

<p>Maria had smiled at her with the greatest sweetness and a certain
wistfulness. Maria was growing delicate, and seemed to inherit her
father's consumptive tendencies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad, Ellen,&rdquo; she said. Then she added,
&ldquo;I suppose we sha'n't see so much of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we sha'n't, Maria Atkins,&rdquo; interposed Abby,
&ldquo;and it won't be fitting we should. It won't be best for Ellen
to associate with shop-girls when she's going to Vassar
College.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen had cast an impetuous arm around a neck of each.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever I do such a thing as that!&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;If ever I turn a cold shoulder to either of you for such a
reason as that! What's Vassar College to hearts? That's at the bottom
of everything in this world, anyhow. I guess you'll see it won't make
any difference unless you keep on thinking such things. If you
do&mdash;if you think I can do anything like that&mdash;I won't love
you so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen faced them both with gathering indignation. Suddenly this
ignoble conception of herself in the minds of her friends stung her
to resentment. But Abby seized her in two wiry little arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did, I never did!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don't I
know what you are made of, Ellen Brewster? Don't you think I know?
But after all, it might be better for you if you were worse. That was
all I meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen, one afternoon, set out in her pretty challis, a white
ground with long sprays of blue flowers running over it, and a blue
ribbon at her neck and waist, and her leghorn hat with white ribbons,
and a knot of forget-me-nots under the brim. She wore her one pair of
nice gloves, too, but those she did not put on until she reached the
corner of the street where Cynthia lived. Then she rubbed them on
carefully, holding up her challis skirts under one arm.</p>

<p>Cynthia was at home, seated on the back veranda, in a rattan
chair, with a book which she was not reading. Ellen stood before her,
in her cheap attire, which she wore with an air which seemed to make
it precious, such faith she had in it. Ellen regarded her coarse
blue-flowered challis with an innocent admiration which seemed almost
able to glorify it into silk. Cynthia took in at a glance the
exceeding commonness of it all; she saw the hat, the like of which
could be seen in the milliners' windows at fabulously low prices; the
foam of spurious lace and the spray of wretched blue flowers made her
shudder. &ldquo;The poor child, she must have something better than
that,&rdquo; she thought, and insensibly she also thought that the
girl must lose her evident faith in the splendor of such attire; must
change her standard of taste. She rose and greeted Ellen sweetly,
though somewhat reservedly. When the two were seated opposite each
other, Cynthia tried to talk pleasantly, but all the time with a
sub-consciousness as one will have of some deformity which must be
ignored. The girl looked so common to her in this array that she
began to have a hopeless feeling of disgust about it all. Was it not
manifestly unwise to try to elevate a girl who took such evident
satisfaction in a gown like that, in a hat like that? Ellen wore her
watch and chain ostentatiously. The watch was too large for a
chatelaine, but she had looped the heavy chain across her bosom, and
pinned it with the brooch which Abby Atkins had given her, so it hung
suspended. Cynthia riveted her eyes helplessly upon that as she
talked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are having a pleasant vacation,&rdquo; said she,
as she looked at the watch, and all at once Ellen knew.</p>

<p>Ellen replied that she was having a very pleasant vacation, then
she plunged at once into the subject of her call, though with inward
trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Lennox,&rdquo; said she&mdash;and she followed the
lines of a little speech which she had been rehearsing to herself all
the way there&mdash;&ldquo;I am very grateful to you for what you
propose doing for me. It will make a difference to me during my whole
life. I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very grateful to be allowed to do it,&rdquo; replied
Cynthia, with her unfailing refrain of gentle politeness, but a
kindly glance was in her eyes. Something in the girl's tone touched
her. It was exceedingly earnest, with the simple earnestness of
childhood. Moreover, Ellen was regarding her with great, steadfast,
serious eyes, like a baby's who shrinks and yet will have her will of
information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to say,&rdquo; Ellen continued&mdash;and her voice
became insensibly hushed, and she cast a glance around at the house
and the leafy grounds, as if to be sure that no one was within
hearing&mdash;&ldquo;that I should never under any circumstances have
said anything regarding what happened so long ago. That I never have
and never should have, that I never thought of doing such a
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the elder woman's face flushed a burning red, and she knew at
once what the girl had suspected. &ldquo;You might proclaim it on the
house-tops if it would please you,&rdquo; she cried out, vehemently.
&ldquo;If you think&mdash;if you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do not!&rdquo; cried Ellen, in an agony of pleading.
&ldquo;Indeed, I do not. It was only that&mdash;I&mdash;feared lest
you might think I would be mean enough to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have told, myself, long ago if there had been only
myself to consider,&rdquo; said Cynthia, still red with anger, and
her voice strained. All at once she seemed to Ellen more like the
woman of her childhood. &ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; said she,
hotly&mdash;&ldquo;I will now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg you not!&rdquo; cried Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go with you this minute and tell your mother,&rdquo;
Cynthia said, rising.</p>

<p>Ellen sprang up and moved towards her as if to push her back in
her chair. &ldquo;Oh, please don't!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Please
don't. You don't know mother; and it would do no good. It was only
because I wondered if you could have thought I would tell, if I would
be so mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you thought, perhaps, I was bribing you not to tell,
with Vassar College,&rdquo; Cynthia said, suddenly. &ldquo;Well, you
have suspected me of something which was undeserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; Ellen said. &ldquo;I did not
suspect, really, but I do not know why you do this for me.&rdquo;
She said the last with her steady eyes of interrogation on Cynthia's
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the reasons I have given.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think they were the only ones,&rdquo; Ellen
replied, stoutly. &ldquo;I do not think my valedictory was so good as
to warrant so much, and I do not think I am so smart as to warrant so
much, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia laughed. She sat down again. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;you are not one to swallow praise greedily.&rdquo;  Then her
tone changed. &ldquo;I owe it to you to tell you why I wish to do
this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I will. You are an honest girl,
with yourself as well as with other people&mdash;too honest, perhaps,
and you deserve that I should be honest with you. I am not doing this
for you in the least, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen stared at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; repeated Cynthia. &ldquo;You are a
very clever, smart girl, I am sure, and it will be a nice thing for
you to have a better education, and be able to take a higher place in
the world, but I am not doing it for you. When you were a little
child I would have done everything, given my life almost, for you,
but I never care so much for children when they grow up. I am not
doing this for you, but for your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother?&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your mother. I know what agony your mother must have
been in, that time when I kept you, and I want to atone in some way.
I think this is a good way. I don't think you need to hesitate about
letting me do it. You also owe a little atonement to your mother. It
was not right for you to run away, in the first place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was very naughty to run away,&rdquo; Ellen said,
starting. She rose, and held out her hand. &ldquo;I hope you will
forgive me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am very grateful, and it will
make my father and mother happier than anything else could, but
indeed I don't think&mdash;it is so long ago&mdash;that there was any
need&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, for the sake of my own distress over it,&rdquo;
Cynthia said, shortly. &ldquo;Suppose, now, we drop the subject, my
dear. There is a taint in the New England blood, and you have it, and
you must fight it. It is a suspicion of the motives of a good deed
which will often poison all the good effect from it. I don't know
where the taint came from. Perhaps the Pilgrim Fathers', being
necessarily always on the watch for the savage behind his gifts, have
affected their descendants. Anyway, it is there. I suppose I have
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I also am sorry,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;I did you a
wrong, and your mother a wrong, years ago. I wonder at myself now,
but you don't know the temptation. You will never know how you looked
to me that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia's voice took on a tone of ineffable tenderness and
yearning. Ellen saw again the old expression in her face; suddenly
she looked as before, young and beautiful, and full of a boundless
attraction. The girl's heart fairly leaped towards her with an
impulse of affection. She could in that minute have fallen at her
feet, have followed her to the end of the world. A great love and
admiration which had gotten its full growth in a second under the
magic of a look and a tone shook her from head to foot. She went
close to Cynthia, and leaned over her, putting her round, young face
down to the elder woman's. &ldquo;Oh, I love you, I love you,&rdquo;
whispered Ellen, with a fervor which was strange to her.</p>

<p>But Cynthia only kissed her lightly on her cheek, and pushed her
away softly. &ldquo;Thank you, my dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am
glad you came and spoke to me frankly, and I am glad we have come to
an understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen, after she had taken her leave, was more in love than she
had ever been in her life, and with another woman. She thought of
Cynthia with adoration; she dreamed about her; the feeling of
receiving a benefit from her hand became immeasurably sweet.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXIII</h3>

<p>Ellen, under the influence of that old fascination which Cynthia
had exerted over her temporarily in her childhood, and which had now
assumed a new lease of life, would have loved to see her every day,
but along with the fascination came a great timidity and fear of
presuming. She felt instinctively that the fascination was an
involuntary thing on Cynthia's part. She kept repeating to herself
what she had said, that she was not sending her to Vassar because she
loved her. Strangely enough, this did not make Ellen unhappy in the
least, she was quite content to do all the loving and adoring
herself. She made a sort of divinity of the older woman, and who
expects a divinity to step down from her marble heights, and love and
caress? Ellen began to remember all Cynthia's ways and looks, as a
scholar remembers with a view to imitation. She became her disciple.
She began to move like Cynthia, and to speak like her, though she did
not know it. Her imitation was totally unconscious; indeed, it was
hardly to be called imitation; it was rather the following out of the
leading of that image of Cynthia which was always present before her
mind. Ellen saw Cynthia very seldom. Once or twice she arrayed
herself in her best and made a formal call of gratitude, and once
Fanny went with her. Ellen saw the incongruity of her mother in
Cynthia's drawing-room with a torture which she never forgot. Going
home she clung hard to her mother's arm all the way. She was fairly
fierce with love and loyalty. She was so indignant with herself that
she had seen the incongruity. &ldquo;I think our parlor is enough
sight prettier than hers,&rdquo; she said, defiantly, when they
reached home and the hideous lamp was lighted. Ellen looked around
the ornate room, and then at her mother, as with a challenge in
behalf of loyalty, and of that which underlies externals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather guess it is,&rdquo; agreed Fanny, happily,
&ldquo;and I don't s'pose it cost half so much. I dare say that mat
on her hearth cost as much as all our plush furniture and the carpet,
and it is a dreadful dull, homely thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I'd been able to keep my hands as white as Miss
Lennox's, an' I wish I'd had time to speak so soft and slow,&rdquo;
said Fanny, wistfully. Then Ellen had her by both shoulders, and was
actually shaking her with a passion to which she very seldom gave
rein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;mother, you know
better, you know there is nobody in the whole world to me like my own
mother, and never will be. It isn't being beautiful, nor speaking in
a soft voice, nor dressing well, it's the being
you&mdash;<em>you</em>. You know I love you best, mother, you know,
and I love my own home best, and everything that is my own best, and
I always will.&rdquo;  Ellen was almost weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You silly child,&rdquo; said Fanny, tenderly. &ldquo;Mother
knows you love her best, but she wishes for your sake, and especially
since you are going to have advantages that she never had, that she
was a little different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't, I don't,&rdquo; said Ellen, fiercely. &ldquo;I
want you just as you are, just exactly as you are, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny laughed tearfully, and rubbed her coarse black head against
Ellen's lovingly with a curious, cat-like motion, then bade her run
away or she would not get her dress done. A dressmaker was coming for
a whole week to the Brewster house to make Ellen's outfit. Mrs.
Zelotes had furnished most of the materials, and Andrew was to pay
the dressmaker. &ldquo;You can take a little more of that money out
of the bank,&rdquo; Fanny said. &ldquo;I want Ellen to go looking so
she won't be ashamed before the other girls, and I don't want Cynthia
Lennox thinking she ain't well enough dressed, and we ought to have
let her do it. As for being beholden to her for Ellen's clothes, I
won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather guess not,&rdquo; said Andrew, but he was sick at
heart. Only that afternoon the man from whom he had borrowed the
money to buy Ellen's watch and chain had asked him for it. He had not
a cent in advance for his weekly pay; he could not see where the
money for Ellen's clothes was coming from. It was long since the
&ldquo;Golden Hope&rdquo; had been quoted in the stock-list, but the
next morning Andrew purchased a morning paper. He had stopped taking
one regularly. He put on his spectacles, and spread out the paper in
his shaking hands, and scrutinized the stock-list eagerly, but he
could not find what he wanted. The &ldquo;Golden Hope&rdquo; had long
since dropped to a still level below all record of fluctuations. A
young man passing to his place at the bench looked over his shoulder.
&ldquo;Counting up your dividends, Brewster?&rdquo; he asked, with a
grin.</p>

<p>Andrew folded up the paper gloomily and made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Irish dividends, maybe,&rdquo; said the man, with a chuckle
at his own wit, and a backward roll of a facetious eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up, you're too smart to live,&rdquo; said the man
who stood next at the bench. He was a young fellow who had been a
school-mate of Ellen in the grammar-school. He had left to go to work
when she had entered the high-school. His name was Dixon. He was wiry
and alert, with a restless sparkle of bright eyes in a grimy face,
and he cut the leather with lightning-like rapidity. Dixon had always
thought Ellen the most beautiful girl in Rowe. He looked after Andrew
with a sharp pain of sympathy when he went away with the roll of
newspaper sticking out of his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old chap,&rdquo; he said to the facetious man,
thrusting his face angrily towards him. &ldquo;He has had a devil of
a time since he begun to grow old. You ought to be ashamed of
yourself. Wait till you begin to drop behind. It's what's bound to
come to the whole boiling of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind your jaw,&rdquo; said the first man, with a scowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better mind yours,&rdquo; said Dixon, slashing
furiously at the leather.</p>

<p>That noon Dixon offered Andrew, shamefacedly, taking him aside
lest the other men see, a piece of pie of a superior sort which his
mother had put into his dinner bag, but Andrew thanked him kindly and
refused it. He could eat nothing whatever that noon. He kept thinking
about the dressmaker, and how Fanny would ask him again to take some
of that money out of the bank to pay her, and how the money was
already taken out.</p>

<p>That evening, when he sat down to the tea-table furnished with the
best china and frosted cake in honor of the dressmaker, and heard the
radiant talk about Ellen's new frills and tucks, he had a cold
feeling at his heart. He was ashamed to look at the dressmaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won't know your daughter when we get her fixed up for
Vassar,&rdquo; she told Andrew, with a smirk which covered her face
with a network of wrinkles under her blond fluff of hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do have some more cake, Miss Higgins,&rdquo; said Fanny.
She was radiant. The image of her daughter in her new gowns had gone
far to recompense her for all her disappointments in life, and they
had not been few. &ldquo;What, after all, did it matter?&rdquo; she
asked herself, &ldquo;if a woman was growing old, if she had to work
hard, if she did not know where the next dollar was coming from, if
all the direct personal savor was fast passing out of existence, when
one had a daughter who looked like that?&rdquo;  Ellen, in a new blue
dress, was ravishing. The mother looked at her when she was trying it
on, with the possession of love, and the dressmaker as if she herself
had created her.</p>

<p>After supper Ellen had to try on the dress again for her father,
and turn about slowly that he might see all its fine points.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, what do you think of that, Andrew?&rdquo; asked
Fanny, triumphantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't she a lady?&rdquo; asked the dressmaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very pretty,&rdquo; said Andrew, smiling with gloomy
eyes. Then he heaved a great sigh, and went out of the south door to
the steps. &ldquo;Your father is tired to-night,&rdquo; Fanny said to
Ellen with a meaning of excuse for the dressmaker.</p>

<p>The dressmaker reflected shrewdly on Andrew's sigh when she was on
her way home. &ldquo;Men don't sigh that way unless there's money to
pay,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I don't believe but he has been
speculating.&rdquo;  Then she wondered if there was any doubt about
her getting her pay, and concluded that she would ask for it from day
to day to make sure.</p>

<p>So the next night after tea she asked, with one of her smirks of
amiability, if it would be convenient for Mrs. Brewster to pay her
that night. &ldquo;I wouldn't ask for it until the end of the
week,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I have a bill to pay.&rdquo;  She
said &ldquo;bill&rdquo; with a murmur which carried conviction of its
deception. Fanny flushed angrily. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;Mr. Brewster can pay you just as well every night if you need
it.&rdquo;  Fanny emphasized the &ldquo;need&rdquo; maliciously. Then
she turned to Andrew. &ldquo;Andrew,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Miss
Higgins needs the money, if you can pay her for yesterday and
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew turned pale. &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; he stammered.
&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six dollars,&rdquo; said Fanny, and in her tone was
unmistakable meaning of the dearness of the price. The dressmaker was
flushed, but her thin mouth was set hard. It was as much as to say,
&ldquo;Well, I don't care so long as I get my money.&rdquo;  She was
unmarried, and her lonely condition had worked up her spirit into a
strong attitude of defiance against all masculine odds. She had once
considered men from a matrimonial point of view. She had wondered if
this one and that one wanted to marry her. Now she was past that, and
considered with equal sharpness if this one or that one wanted to
cheat her. She had missed men's love through some failing either of
theirs or hers. She did not know which, but she was determined that
she would not lose money. So she bore Fanny's insulting emphasis with
rigidity, and waited for her pay.</p>

<p>Andrew pulled out his old pocket-book, and counted the bills. Miss
Higgins saw that he took every bill in it, unless there were some in
another compartment, and of that she could not be quite sure. But
Andrew knew. He would not have another penny until the next week when
he received his pay. In the meantime there was a bill due at the
grocery store, and one at the market, and there was the debt for
Ellen's watch. However, he felt as if he would rather owe every man
in Rowe than this one small, sharp woman. He felt the scorn lurking
within her like a sting. She seemed to him like some venomous insect.
He went out to the doorstep again, and wondered if she would want her
pay the next night when she went home.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXIV</h3>

<p>Ellen had a flower-garden behind the house, and a row of
sweet-peas which was her pride. It had occurred to her that she might
venture, although Cynthia Lennox had her great garden and
conservatories, to carry her a bunch of these sweet-peas. She had
asked her mother what she thought about it. &ldquo;Why, of course,
carry her some if you want to,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I don't see
why you shouldn't. I dare say she's got sweet-peas, but yours are
uncommon handsome, and, anyway, it ought to please her to have some
given her. It ain't altogether what's given, it's the
giving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Ellen had cut a great bouquet of the delicate flowers,
selecting the shades carefully, and set forth. She was as guiltily
conscious as a lover that she was making an excuse to see Miss
Lennox. She hurried along in delight and trepidation, her great
bouquet shedding a penetrating fragrance around her, her face
gleaming white out of the dusk. She had to pass Granville Joy's house
on her way, and saw with some dismay, as she drew near, a figure
leaning over the gate.</p>

<p>He pushed open the gate when she drew near, and stood waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Ellen,&rdquo; he said. He was mindful not to
say &ldquo;Hullo&rdquo; again. He bowed with a piteous imitation of
Robert Lloyd, but Ellen did not notice it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; she returned, rather stiffly, then she
added, in a very gentle voice, to make amends, that it was a
beautiful night.</p>

<p>The young man cast an appreciative glance at the crescent moon in
the jewel-like blue overhead, and at the soft shadows of the
trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, beautiful,&rdquo; he replied, with a sort of
gratitude, as if the girl had praised him instead of the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I walk along with you?&rdquo; he asked, falling into
step with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to take these sweet-peas to Miss Lennox,&rdquo;
said Ellen, without replying directly.</p>

<p>She was in terror lest Granville should renew his appeal of a few
weeks before, and she was in terror of her own pity for him, and also
of that mysterious impulse and longing which sometimes seized her to
her own wonder and discomfiture. Sometimes, in thinking of Granville
Joy, and his avowal of love, and the touch of his hand on hers, and
his lips on hers, she felt, although she knew she did not love him, a
softening of her heart and a quickening of her pulse which made her
wonder as to her next movement, if it might be something which she
had not planned. And always, after thinking of Granville, she thought
of Robert Lloyd; some mysterious sequence seemed to be established
between the two in the girl's mind, though she was not in love with
either.</p>

<p>Ellen was just at that period almost helpless before the demands
of her own nature. No great stress in her life had occurred to awaken
her to a stanchness either of resistance or yielding. She was in the
full current of her own emotions, which, added to a goodly flood
inherited from the repressed passion of New England ancestors, had a
strong pull upon her feet. Sooner or later she would be given that
hard shake of life which precipitates and organizes in all strong
natures, but just now she was in a ferment. She walked along under
the crescent moon, with the young man at her side whose every thought
and imagination was dwelling upon her with love. She was conscious of
a tendency of her own imagination in his direction, or rather in the
direction of the love and passion which he represented, and all the
time her heart was filled with the ideal image of another woman. She
was prostrated with that hero-worship which belongs to young and
virgin souls, and yet she felt the drawing of that other admiration
which is more earthly and more fascinating, as it shows the jewel
tints in one's own soul as well as in the other.</p>

<p>As for Granville Joy, who had scrubbed his hands and face well
with scented soap to take away the odor of the leather, and put on a
clean shirt and collar, being always prepared for the possibility of
meeting this dainty young girl whom he loved, he walked along by her
side, casting, from time to time, glances which were pure admiration
at the face over the great bunch of sweet-peas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you want me to carry them for you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Ellen. &ldquo;They are
nothing to carry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're real pretty flowers,&rdquo; said Granville,
timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother planted some, but hers didn't come up. Mother has
got some beautiful nasturtiums. Perhaps you would like some,&rdquo;
he said, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, I have some myself,&rdquo; Ellen said,
rather coldly. &ldquo;I'm just as much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granville quivered a little and shrank as a dog might under a
blow. He saw this dainty girl-shape floating along at his side in a
flutter of wonderful draperies, one hand holding up her skirts with
maddening revelations of whiteness. If a lily could hold up her
petals out of the dust she might do it in the same fashion as Ellen
held her skirts, with no coarse clutching nor crumpling, not
immodestly, but rather with disclosures of modesty itself. Ellen's
wonderful daintiness was one of her chief charms. There was an
immaculateness about her attire and her every motion which seemed to
extend to her very soul, and hedged her about with the lure of
unapproachableness. It was more that than her beauty which roused the
imagination and quickened the pulses of a young man regarding
her.</p>

<p>Granville Joy did not feel the earth beneath his feet as he walked
with Ellen. The scent of the sweet-peas came in his face, he heard
the soft rustle of Ellen's skirts and his own heart-beats. She was
very silent, since she did not wish him to go with her, though she
was all the time reproaching herself for it. Granville kept casting
about for something to say which should ingratiate him with her. He
was resolved to say nothing of love to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful night,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; agreed Ellen, and she looked at the
moon. She felt the boy's burning, timid, worshipful eyes on her face.
She trembled, and yet she was angry and annoyed. She felt in an
undefined fashion that she herself was the summer night and the
flowers and the crescent moon, and all that was fair and beautiful in
the whole world to this other soul, and shame seized her instead of
pride. He seemed to force her to a sight of her own pettiness, as is
always the case when love is not fully returned. She made an
impatient motion with the shoulder next Granville, and walked
faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said you were going to Miss Lennox's,&rdquo; he
remarked, anxiously, feeling that in some way he had displeased
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to carry her some sweet-peas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have been real good-looking when she was
young,&rdquo; Granville said, injudiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When she was young,&rdquo; retorted Ellen, angrily.
&ldquo;She is beautiful now. There is not another woman in Rowe as
beautiful as she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she is good-looking enough,&rdquo; agreed Granville,
with unreasoning jealousy. He had not heard of Ellen's good fortune.
His mother had not told him. She was a tenderly sentimental woman,
and had always had her fancies with regard to her son and Ellen
Brewster. When she heard the news she reflected that it would perhaps
remove the girl from her boy immeasurably, that he would be pained,
so she said nothing. Every night when he came home she had watched
his face to see if he had heard.</p>

<p>Now Ellen told him. &ldquo;You know what Miss Cynthia Lennox is
going to do for me,&rdquo; she said, abruptly, almost boastfully, she
was so eager in her partisanship of Cynthia.</p>

<p>Granville looked at her blankly. They were coming into the
crowded, brilliantly lighted main street of the city, and their two
faces were quite plain to each other's eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What is it,
Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is going to send me to Vassar College.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granville's face whitened perceptibly. There was a queer sound in
his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Vassar College!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to Vassar College. Then I shall be able to get a good
school, and teach, and help father and mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granville continued to look at her, and suddenly an intense pity
sprang into life in the girl's heart. She felt as if she were looking
at some poor little child, instead of a stalwart young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't look so, Granville,&rdquo; she said, softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am glad at any good fortune which can come to
you, Ellen,&rdquo; Granville said then, huskily. His lips quivered a
little, but his eyes on her face were brave and faithful. Suddenly
Ellen seemed to see in this young man a counterpart of her own
father. Granville had a fine, high forehead and contemplative
outlook. He had been a good scholar. Many said that it was a pity he
had to leave school and go to work. It had been the same with her
father. Andrew had always looked immeasurably above his labor. She
seemed to see Granville Joy in the future just such a man, a finer
animal harnessed to the task of a lower, and harnessed in part by his
own loving faithfulness towards others. Ellen had often reflected
that, if it hadn't been for her and her mother, her father would not
have been obliged to work so hard. Now in Granville she saw another
man whom love would hold to the ploughshare. A great impulse of
loyalty as towards her own came over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won't make any difference between me and my old friends
if I do go to Vassar College,&rdquo; she said, without reflecting on
the dangerous encouragement of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can't get into another track of life without its making
a difference,&rdquo; returned Granville, soberly. &ldquo;But I am
glad. God knows I'm glad, Ellen. I dare say it is better for you than
if&mdash;&rdquo;  He stopped then and seemed all at once to see
projected on his mirror of the future this dainty, exquisite girl,
with her fine intellect, dragging about a poor house, with wailing
children in arm and at heel, and suddenly a great courage of
renunciation came over him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> better, Ellen,&rdquo; he said, in a loud
voice, like a hero's, as if he were cheering his own better impulses
on to victory over his own passions. &ldquo;It is better for a girl
like you, than to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen knew that he meant to say, &ldquo;to marry a fellow like
me.&rdquo;  Ellen looked at him, the sturdy backward fling of his
head and shoulders, and the honest regard of his pained yet
unflinching eyes, and a great weakness of natural longing for that
which she was even now deprecating nearly overswept her. She was
nearer loving him that moment than ever before. She realized
something in him which could command love&mdash;the renunciation of
love for love's sake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget my old friends, whatever
happens,&rdquo; she said, in a trembling voice, and it might have all
been different had they not then arrived at Cynthia Lennox's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I wait and go home with you, Ellen?&rdquo; Granville
asked, timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I don't know how long I shall stay,&rdquo;
Ellen replied. &ldquo;You are real kind, but I am not a bit
afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is sort of lonesome going past the shops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can take a car,&rdquo; Ellen said. She extended her hand
to Granville, and he grasped it firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Ellen; I am always glad of any good fortune
that may come to you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>But Granville Joy, going alone down the brilliant street, past the
blaze of the shop-windows and the knots of loungers on the corners,
reflected that he had seen the fiery tip of a cigar on the Lennox
veranda, that it might be possible that young Lloyd was there, since
Miss Lennox was his aunt, and that possibly the aunt's sending Ellen
to Vassar might bring about something in that quarter which would not
otherwise have happened, and he writhed at the fancy of that sort of
good fortune for Ellen, but held his mind to it resolutely as to some
terrible but necessary grindstone for the refinement of spirit.
&ldquo;It would be a heap better for her,&rdquo; he said to himself,
quite loud, and two men whom he was passing looked at him curiously.
&ldquo;Drunk,&rdquo; said one to the other.</p>

<p>When he was on his homeward way he overtook a slender girl
struggling along with a kerosene-can in one hand and a package of
sugar in the other, and, seeing that it was Abby Atkins, he possessed
himself of both. She only laughed and did not start. Abby Atkins was
not of the jumping or screaming kind, her nerves were so finely
balanced that they recovered their equilibrium, after surprises,
before she had time for manifestations. There was a curious
healthfulness about the slender, wiry little creature who was
overworked and under-fed, a healthfulness which seemed to result from
the action of the mind upon a meagre body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Granville Joy!&rdquo; she said, in her good-comrade
fashion, and the two went on together. Presently Abby looked up in
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know about Ellen?&rdquo; said she. Granville nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'm glad of it, aren't you?&rdquo; Abby said, in a
challenging tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied Granville, meeting her look
firmly.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt Abby's little, meagre, bony hand close over the
back of his, holding the kerosene-can. &ldquo;You're a good fellow,
Granville Joy,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Granville marched on and made no response. He felt his throat fill
with sobs, and swallowed convulsively. Along with this womanly
compassion came a compassion for himself, so hurt on his little field
of battle. He saw his own wounds as one might see a stranger's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of Ellen dogging around to a shoe-shop like me and
the other girls,&rdquo; said Abby, &ldquo;and think of her draggin'
around with half a dozen children and no money. Thank the Lord she's
lifted out of it. It ain't you nor me that ought to grudge her
fortune to her, nor wish her where she might have been
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>Abby's hand tightened over the one on the kerosene-can. &ldquo;You
are a good fellow, Granville Joy,&rdquo; she said again.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXV</h3>

<p>Robert Lloyd was sitting on the veranda behind the green trail of
vines when Ellen came up the walk. He never forgot the girl's face
looking over her bunch of sweet-peas. There was in it something
indescribably youthful and innocent, almost angelic. The light from
the window made her hair toss into gold; her blue eyes sought Cynthia
with the singleness of blue stars. It was evident whom she had come
to see. She held out her flowers towards her with a gesture at once
humble and worshipful, like that of some devotee at a shrine.</p>

<p>She said &ldquo;Good-evening&rdquo; with a shy comprehensiveness,
then, to Cynthia, like a child, &ldquo;I thought maybe you would like
some of my sweet-peas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both gentlemen rose, and Risley looked curiously from the young
girl to Cynthia, then placed his chair for her, smiling kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sweet-peas are lovely,&rdquo; Cynthia said.
&ldquo;Thank you, my dear. They are much prettier than any I have had
in my garden this year. Please sit down,&rdquo; for Ellen was
doubtful about availing herself of the proffered chair. She had so
hoped that she might find Cynthia alone. She had dreamed, as a lover
might have done, of a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with her, what
she would say, what Cynthia would say. She had thought, and trembled
at the thought, that possibly Cynthia might kiss her when she came or
went. She had felt, with a thrill of spirit, the touch of Cynthia's
soft lips on hers, she had smelt the violets about her clothes. Now
it was all spoiled. She remembered things which she had heard about
Mr. Risley's friendship with Cynthia, how he had danced attendance
upon her for half a lifetime, and thought that she did not like him.
She looked at his smiling, grizzled, blond face with distrust. She
felt intuitively that he saw straight through her little subterfuge
of the flowers, that he divined her girlish worship at the shrine of
Cynthia, and was making fun of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you object to a cigar, Miss Brewster?&rdquo; asked
Robert, and Risley looked inquiringly at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Ellen, with the eager readiness of a
child to fit into new conditions. She thought of the sitting-room at
home, blue with the rank pipe-smoke of Nahum Beals and his kind. She
pictured them to herself sitting about on these warm evenings in
their shirt-sleeves, and she saw the two gentlemen in their light
summer clothes with their fragrant cigars at their lips, and all of a
sudden she realized that between these men and the others there was a
great gulf, and that she was trying to cross it. She did not realize,
as later, that the gulf was one of externals, and of width rather
than depth, but it seemed to her then that from one shore she could
only see dimly the opposite. A great fear and jealousy came over her
as to her own future accessibility to those of the other kind among
whom she had been brought up, like her father and Granville.</p>

<p>Ellen felt all this as she sat beside Cynthia, who was casting
about in her mind, in rather an annoyed fashion, for something to say
to this young beneficiary of hers which should not have anything to
do with the benefit.</p>

<p>Finally she inquired if she were having a pleasant vacation, and
Ellen replied that she was. Risley looked at her beautiful face with
the double radiance of the electric-light and the lamp-light from the
window on it, giving it a curious effect. It suddenly occurred to him
to wonder why everybody seemed to have such an opinion as to the
talents of this girl. Why did Cynthia consider that her native
ability warranted this forcible elevation of her from her own sphere
and setting her on a height of education above her kind? She looked
and spoke like an ordinary young girl. She had a beautiful face, it
is true, and her shyness seemed due to the questioning attitude of a
child rather than to self-consciousness, but, after all, why did she
give people that impression? Her valedictory had been clever, no
doubt, and there was in it a certain fire of conviction, which,
though crude, was moving; but, after all, almost any bright girl
might have written it. She had been a fine scholar, no doubt, but any
girl with a ready intelligence might have done as well. Whence came
this inclination of all to rear the child upon a pedestal? Risley
wondered, looking at her, narrowing his keen, light eyes under
reflective brows, puffing at his cigar; then he admitted to himself
that he was one with the crowd of Ellen's admirers. There was somehow
about the girl that which gave the impression of an enormous reserve
out of all proportion to any external evidence. &ldquo;The child says
nothing remarkable,&rdquo; he told Cynthia, after she had gone that
evening, &ldquo;but somehow she gives me an impression of power to
say something extraordinary, and do something extraordinary. There is
electricity and steel behind that soft, rosy flesh of hers. But all
she does which is evident to the eye of man is to worship you,
Cynthia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worship me?&rdquo; repeated Cynthia, vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has one of those aberrations common to her youth
and her sex. She is repeating a madness of old Greece, and following
you as a nymph might a goddess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only because she is grateful,&rdquo; returned
Cynthia, looking rather annoyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gratitude may be a factor in it, but it is very far from
being the whole of the matter. It is one of the spring madnesses of
life; but don't be alarmed, it will be temporary in the case of a
girl like that. She will easily be led into her natural track of
love. Do you know, Cynthia, that she is one of the most normal,
typical young girls I ever saw, and that makes me wonder more at this
impression of unusual ability which she undoubtedly gives. She has
all the weaknesses of her age and sex, she is much younger than some
girls of her age, and yet there is the impression which I cannot
shake off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it, too,&rdquo; said Cynthia, rather
impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cynthia Lennox, I don't believe you care in the least for
this young devotee of yours, for all you are heaping benefits upon
her,&rdquo; Risley said, looking at her quizzically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I do,&rdquo; replied Cynthia,
calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why on earth&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Cynthia began speaking rapidly and passionately,
straightening herself in her chair. &ldquo;Oh, Lyman, do you think I
could do a thing like that, and not repent it and suffer remorse for
it all these years?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thing like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like stealing that child,&rdquo; Cynthia replied, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stealing the child? You did not steal the child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it was only a few hours that you kept her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What difference does it make whether you steal anything for
a few hours or a lifetime? I kept her, and she was crying for her
mother, and her mother was suffering tortures all that time. Then I
kept it secret all these years. You didn't know what I have suffered,
Lyman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia regarded him with a wan look.</p>

<p>Risley half laughed, then checked himself. &ldquo;My poor girl,
you have the New England conscience in its worst form,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You yourself told me it was a serious thing I was
doing,&rdquo; Cynthia said, half resentfully. &ldquo;One does not
wish one's sin treated lightly when one has hugged its pricks to
one's bosom for so long&mdash;it detracts from the dignity of
suffering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I did, but all those years ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don't leave me my remorse, how can I atone for the
deed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cynthia, you are horribly morbid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you are right, maybe it is worse than morbid.
Sometimes I think I am unnatural, out of drawing, but I did not make
myself, and how can I help it?&rdquo;  Cynthia spoke with a pathetic
little laugh.</p>

<p>She leaned her head back in her chair, and looked at a star
through a gap in the vines. The shadows of the leaves played over her
long, white figure. Again to Risley, gazing at her, came the
conviction as of subtle spiritual deformity in the woman; she was
unnatural in something the same fashion that an orchid is unnatural,
and it was worse, because presumably the orchid does not know it is
an orchid and regret not being another, more evenly developed,
flower, and Cynthia had a full realization and a mental mirror clear
enough to see the twist in her own character.</p>

<p>Risley had never kissed her in his life, but that night, when they
parted, he laid a hand on her soft, gray hair, and smoothed it back
with a masculine motion of tenderness, leaving her white forehead,
which had a candid, childish fulness about the temples, bare. Then he
put his lips to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a silly girl, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I were different, Lyman,&rdquo; she responded, and,
he felt, with a double meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; he said, and stroked her hair with a great
tenderness, which seemed for the time to quite fill and satisfy his
heart. He was a man of measureless patience, born to a firm
conviction of the journey's end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are worse things than loving a good woman your whole
life and never having her,&rdquo; he said to himself as he went home,
but he said it without its full meaning. Risley's
&ldquo;nerves&rdquo; were always lighted by the lamp of his own hope,
which threw a gleam over unknown seas.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXVI</h3>

<p>Robert Lloyd accompanied Ellen home, though she had said timidly
that she was not in the least afraid, that she would not trouble any
one, that she could take a car. Cynthia herself had insisted that
Robert should escort her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's too late for you to be out alone,&rdquo; she said, and
the girl seemed to perceive dimly a hedge of conventionality which
she had not hitherto known. She had often taken a car when she was
alone of an evening, without a thought of anything questionable. Some
of the conductors lived near Ellen, and she felt as if she were under
personal friendly escort. &ldquo;I know the conductor on that car,
and it would take me right home, and I am not in the least
afraid,&rdquo; she said to Robert, as the car came rocking down the
street when they emerged from Cynthia's grounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a lovely night,&rdquo; Robert said, speaking quickly
as they paused on the sidewalk. &ldquo;I am not going to let you go
alone, anyway. We will take the car if you say so, but what do you
say to walking? It's a lovely night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It actually flashed through Ellen's mind&mdash;to such small
issues of finance had she been accustomed&mdash;that the young man
might insist upon paying her car-fare if he went with her on the
car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to walk, but I am sorry to put you to so much
trouble,&rdquo; she said, a little awkwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I like to walk,&rdquo; returned Robert. &ldquo;I don't
walk half enough,&rdquo; and they went together down the lighted
street. Suddenly to Ellen there came a vivid remembrance, so vivid
that it seemed almost like actual repetition of the time when she, a
little child, maddened by the sudden awakening of the depths of her
nature, had come down this same street. She saw that same brilliant
market-window where she had stopped and stared, to the momentary
forgetfulness of her troubles in the spectacular display of that
which was entirely outside them. Curiously enough, Robert drew her to
a full stop that night before the same window. It was one of those
strange cases of apparent telepathy which one sometimes notices. When
Ellen looked at the market-window, with a flash of reminiscence,
Robert immediately drew her to a stop before it. &ldquo;That is quite
a study in color,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I fancy there are a good
many unrecognized artists among market-men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is really beautiful,&rdquo; agreed Ellen, looking
at it with eyes which had changed very little from their childish
outlook. Again she saw more than she saw. The window differed
materially from that before which she had stood fascinated so many
years ago, for that was in a different season. Instead of frozen game
and winter vegetables, were the products of summer gardens, and
fruits, and berries. The color scheme was dazzling with great heaps
of tomatoes, and long, emerald ears of corn, and baskets of apples,
and gold crooks of summer squashes, and speckled pods of beans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Robert, as they walked on, &ldquo;that
all the market-men who had artistic tastes had art educations and set
up studios and painted pictures, who would keep the
markets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke gayly. His manner that night was younger and merrier than
Ellen had ever seen it. She was naturally rather grave herself. What
she had seen of life had rather disposed her to a hush of respect
than to hilarity, but somehow his mood began to infect her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she answered, laughing, &ldquo;I
suppose somebody would keep the markets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they would not be as good markets. That is, they
would not do as artistic markets, and they would not serve the higher
purpose of catering to the artistic taste of man, as well as to his
bodily needs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a picture like that is just as well and better than
it would be painted and hung on a wall,&rdquo; Ellen admitted,
reflectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so&mdash;why is it not?&rdquo; Robert said, in a
pleased voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it is,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;I do think it
is better, because everybody can see it there. Ever so many people
will see it there who would not go to picture-galleries to see it,
and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then it may go far to dignify their daily needs,&rdquo;
said Robert. &ldquo;For instance, a poor man about to buy his
to-morrow's dinner may feel his soul take a little fly above the
prices of turnips and cabbages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Ellen, but doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prices of turnips and cabbages may crowd other things
out,&rdquo; Ellen replied, and her tone was sad, almost tragic.
&ldquo;You see I am right in it, Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; she said,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean right in the midst of the kind of people whom
necessity forces to neglect the &aelig;sthetic for the purely
useful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen. Then she added, in an indescribably
pathetic voice, &ldquo;People have to live first before they can see,
and they can't think until they are fed, and one needs always to have
had enough turnips and cabbages to eat without troubling about the
getting them, in order to see in them anything except
food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lloyd looked at her curiously. &ldquo;Decidedly this child can
think,&rdquo; he reflected. He shrugged his arm, on which Ellen's
hand lay, a little closer to his side.</p>

<p>Just then they were passing the great factories&mdash;Lloyd's, and
Briggs's, and Maguire's. Many of the windows in Briggs's and
Maguire's reflected light from the moon and the electric-lamps on the
street. Lloyd's was all dark except for one brilliant spark of light,
which seemed to be threading the building like a will-o'-the-wisp.
&ldquo;That is the night-watchman,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;He must
have a dull time of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think he might be afraid,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghosts in a shoe-shop?&rdquo; asked Robert, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe there has been another building in the
whole city which has held so many heart-aches, and I always wondered
if they didn't make ghosts instead of dead people,&rdquo; Ellen
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they have such a hard time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know they do,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;I think I ate the
knowledge along with my first daily bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert Lloyd looked down at the light, girlish figure on his arm,
and again the resolution that he would not talk on such topics with a
young girl like this came over him. He felt a reluctance to do so
which was quite apart from his masculine scorn of a girl's opinion on
such matters. Somehow he did not wish to place Ellen Brewster on the
same level of argument on which another man might have stood. He felt
a jealousy of doing so. She seemed more within his reach, and
infinitely more for his pleasure, where she was. He looked admiringly
down at her fair face fixed on his with a serious, intent expression.
He was quite ready to admit that he might fall in love with her. He
was quite ready to ask now why he should not. She was a beautiful
girl, an uncommon girl. She was going to be thoroughly educated. It
would probably be quite possible to divorce her entirely from her
surroundings. He shuddered when he thought of her mother and aunt,
but, after all, a man, if he were firm, need not marry the mother or
aunt. And all this was in spite of a resolution which he had formed
on due consideration after his last call upon Ellen. He had said to
himself that it would not in any case be wise, that he had better not
see more of her than he could help. Instead of going to see her, he
had gone riding with Maud Hemingway, who lived near his uncle's, in
an old Colonial house which had belonged to her great-grandfather.
The girl was a good comrade, so good a comrade that she shunted, as
it were, love with flings of ready speech and friendly greeting, and
tennis-rackets and riding-whips and foils. Robert had been teaching
Maud to fence, and she had fenced too well. Still, Robert had said to
himself that he might some day fall in love with her and marry her.
He charged his memory with the fact that this was a much more
rational course than visiting a girl like Ellen Brewster, so he
stayed away in spite of involuntary turnings of his thoughts in that
direction. However, now when the opportunity had seemed to be fairly
forced upon him, what was he to do? He felt that he was stirred as he
had never been before. The girl's very soul seemed to meet his when
she looked up at him with those serious blue eyes of hers. He knew
that there had never been any like her for him, but he felt as if in
another minute, if they did not drop topics which he might as well
have discussed with another man, this butterfly of femininity which
so delighted him would be beyond his hand. He wanted to keep her to
her rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the knowledge must not imbitter your life,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It is not for a little, delicate girl to worry herself
over the problems which are too much for men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of himself a tenderness had come into his voice. Ellen
looked down and away from him. She trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that the problems of life, like those in the
algebra we studied at school, are for everybody who can read them,
whether men or women,&rdquo; said she, but her voice was
unsteady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them are for men to read and struggle with for the
sake of the women,&rdquo; said Robert. His voice had a tender
inflection. They were passing a garden full of old-fashioned flowers,
bordered with box. The scent of the box seemed fairly to clamor over
the garden fence, drowning out the smaller fragrances of the flowers,
like the clamor of a mob. Even the sweetness of the mignonette was
faintly perceived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How strong the box is,&rdquo; said Ellen, imperceptibly
shrinking a little from Robert.</p>

<p>When they reached the Brewster house Robert said, as kindly as
Granville Joy might have done, &ldquo;Cannot we get better
acquainted, Miss Brewster? May I call upon you sometimes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be happy to see you,&rdquo; Ellen said, repeating
the formula of welcome like a child, but she knew when she repeated
it that it was very true. After she had parted from young Lloyd, she
went into the sitting-room where were her mother and father, her
mother sewing on a wrapper, her father reading the paper. Both of
them looked up as the girl entered, and both stared at her in a
bewildered way without rightly knowing why. Ellen's cheeks were a
wonderful color, her eyes fairly blazed with blue light, her mouth
was smiling in that ineffable smile of a simple overflow of
happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ride home on the car?&rdquo; asked Fanny. &ldquo;I
didn't hear it stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you come home alone?&rdquo; asked Andrew, abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ellen, blinking before the glare of the
lamp. Fanny looked at Andrew. &ldquo;Who did come home with
you?&rdquo; she asked, in a foolish, fond voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robert Lloyd. He was sitting on the piazza when I got
there. I told Miss Lennox I had just as soon come on the cars alone,
but she wouldn't let me, and then he said it would be pleasant to
walk, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn't make so many excuses,&rdquo; said Fanny,
laughing.</p>

<p>Ellen colored until her face was a blaze of roses, she blinked
harder, and turned her head away impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not making excuses,&rdquo; said she, as if her modesty
were offended. &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't talk so, mother. I couldn't
help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you couldn't,&rdquo; her mother called out
jocularly, as Ellen went into the other room to get her lamp to go to
bed.</p>

<p>Fanny was radiant with delight. After Ellen had gone up-stairs,
she kept looking at Andrew, and longing to confide in him her
anticipation with regard to Ellen and young Lloyd, but she refrained,
being doubtful as to how he would take it. Andrew looked very sober.
The girl's beautiful, metamorphosed face was ever before his eyes,
and it was with him as if he were looking after the flight of a
beloved bird into a farther blue which was sacred, even from the
following of his love.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXVII</h3>

<p>Ellen's first impulse, when she really began to love Robert Lloyd,
was not yielding, but flight; her first sensation, not happiness, but
shame. When he left her that night she realized, to her unspeakable
dismay and anger, that he had not left her, that he would never in
her whole life, or at least it seemed so, leave her again. Everywhere
she looked she saw his face projected by her memory before her with
all the reality of life. His face came between her and her mother's
and father's, it came between her and her thoughts of other faces.
When she was alone in her chamber, there was the face. She blew out
the lamp in a panic of resentment and undressed in the dark, but that
made no difference. When she lay in bed, although she closed her eyes
resolutely, she could still see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't have it; I won't have it,&rdquo; she said, quite
aloud in her shame and rebellion. &ldquo;I won't have it. What does
this mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of herself the sound of his voice was in her ears, and
she resented that; she fought against the feeling of utter rapture
which came stealing over her because of it. She felt as if she wanted
to spring out of bed and run, run far away into the freedom of the
night, if only by so doing she could outspeed herself. Ellen began to
realize the tyranny of her own nature, and her whole soul arose in
revolt.</p>

<p>But the girl could no more escape than a nymph of old the pursuit
of the god, and there was no friendly deity to transform her into a
flower to elude him. When she slept at last she was overtaken in the
innocent passion of dreams, and when she awoke it was, to her angry
sensitiveness, not alone.</p>

<p>When she went down-stairs all her rosy radiance of the night
before was eclipsed. She looked pale and nervous. She recoiled
whenever her mother began to speak. It seemed to her that if she said
anything, and especially anything congratulatory about Robert Lloyd,
she would fly at her like a wild thing. Fanny kept looking at her
with loving facetiousness, and Ellen winced indescribably; still, she
did not say anything until after breakfast, when Andrew had gone to
work. Andrew was unusually sober and preoccupied that morning. When
he went out he passed close to Ellen, as she sat at the table, and
tilted up her face and kissed her. &ldquo;Father's blessin',&rdquo;
he whispered, hoarsely, in her ear. Ellen nestled against him. This
natural affection, before which she need not fly nor be ashamed,
which she had always known, seemed to come before her like a shield
against all untried passion. She felt sheltered and comforted. But
Andrew passed Eva Tenny coming to the house on his way out of the
yard, and when she entered Fanny began at once:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you s'pose came home with Ellen last night?&rdquo;
said she. She looked at Eva, then at Ellen, with a glance which
seemed to uncover a raw surface of delicacy. Ellen flushed
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I do wish&mdash;&rdquo; she began; but Fanny cut
her short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's pretendin' she don't like it,&rdquo; she said, almost
hilariously, her face glowing with triumph, &ldquo;but she does. You
ought to have seen her when she came in last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I know who it was,&rdquo; said Eva, but she echoed
her sister's manner half-heartedly. She was looking very badly that
morning, her face was stained, and her eye hard with a look as if
tears had frozen in them. She had come in a soiled waist, too,
without any collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Heaven's sake, Eva Tenny, what ails you?&rdquo; Fanny
cried.</p>

<p>Eva flung herself for answer on the floor, and fairly writhed.
Words were not enough expression for her violent temperament. She had
to resort to physical manifestations or lose her reason. As she
writhed, she groaned as one might do who was dying in extremity of
pain.</p>

<p>Ellen, when she heard her aunt's groans, stopped, and stood in the
entry viewing it all. She thought at first that her aunt was ill, and
was just about to call out to know if she should go for the doctor,
all her grievances being forgotten in this evidently worse stress,
when her mother fairly screamed again, stooping over her sister, and
trying to raise her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva Tenny, you tell me this minute what the matter
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Eva raised herself on one elbow, and disclosed a face
distorted with wrath and woe, like a mask of tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's gone! he's gone!&rdquo; she shrieked out, in an awful,
shrill voice, which was like the note of an angry bird. &ldquo;He's
gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God's sake, not&mdash;Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he's gone! he's gone! Oh, my God! my God! he's
gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All at once the little Amabel appeared, slipping past Ellen
silently. She stood watching her mother. She was vibrating from head
to foot as if strung on wires. She was not crying, but she kept
catching her breath audibly; her little hands were twitching in the
folds of her frock; she winked rapidly, her lids obscuring and
revealing her eyes until they seemed a series of blue sparks. She was
no paler than usual&mdash;that was scarcely possible&mdash;but her
skin looked transparent, pulses were evident all over her face and
her little neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't mean he's gone with&mdash;?&rdquo; gasped
Fanny.</p>

<p>Suddenly Eva raised herself with a convulsive jerk from the floor
to her feet. She stood quite still. &ldquo;Yes, he has gone,&rdquo;
she said, and all the passion was gone from her voice, which was much
more terrible in its calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't mean with&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; he has gone with Aggie.&rdquo;  Eva spoke in a voice
like a deaf-mute's, quite free from inflections. There was something
dreadful about her rigid attitude. Little Amabel looked at her
mother's eyes, then cowered down and began to cry aloud. Ellen came
in and took her in her arms, whispering to her to soothe her. She
tried to coax her away, but the child resisted violently, though she
was usually so docile with Ellen.</p>

<p>Eva did not seem to notice Amabel's crying. She stood in that
horrible inflexibility, with eyes like black stones fixed on
something unseeable.</p>

<p>Fanny clutched her violently by the arm and shook her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva Tenny,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you behave yourself.
What if he has run away? You ain't the first woman whose husband has
run away. I'd have more pride. I wouldn't please him nor her enough.
If he's as bad as that, you're better off rid of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva turned on her sister, and her calm broke up like ice under her
fire of passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you say one word against him, not one word!&rdquo;
she shrieked, throwing off Fanny's hand. &ldquo;I won't hear one word
against my husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then little Amabel joined in. &ldquo;Don't you say one word
against my papa!&rdquo; she cried, in her shrill, childish treble.
Then she sobbed convulsively, and pushed Ellen away. &ldquo;Go
away!&rdquo; she said, viciously, to her. She was half mad with
terror and bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you say one word against Jim,&rdquo; said Eva again.
&ldquo;If ever I hear anybody say one word against him
I'll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't mean you're goin' to stan' up for him, Eva
Tenny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as I draw the breath of life, and after, if I know
anything,&rdquo; declared Eva. Then she straightened herself to her
full height, threw back her shoulders, and burst into a furious
denunciation like some prophetess of wrath. The veins on her forehead
grew turgid, her lips seemed to swell, her hair seemed to move as she
talked. The others shrank back and looked at her; even little Amabel
hushed her sobs and stared, fascinated. &ldquo;Curses on the grinding
tyranny that's brought it all about, and not on the poor, weak man
that fell under it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Jim ain't to blame. He's
had bigger burdens put on his shoulders than the Lord gave him
strength to bear. He had to drop 'em. Jim has tried faithful ever
since we were married. He worked hard, and it wa'n't never his fault
that he lost his place, but he kept losin' it. They kept shuttin'
down, or dischargin' him for no reason at all, without a minute's
warnin'. An' it wa'n't because he drank. Jim never drank when he had
a job. He was just taken up and put down by them over him as if he
was a piece on a checker-board. He lost his good opinion of himself
when he saw others didn't set any more by him than to shove him off
or on the board as it suited their play. He began to think maybe he
wa'n't a man, and then he began to act as if he wasn't a man. And he
was ashamed of his life because he couldn't support me and Amabel,
ashamed of his life because he had to live on my little earnin's. He
was ashamed to look me in the face, and ashamed to look his own child
in the face. It was only night before last he was talkin' to me, and
I didn't know what he meant then, but I know now. I thought then he
meant something else, but now I know what he meant. He sat a long
time leanin' his head on his hands, whilst I was sewin' on wrappers,
after Amabel had gone to bed, and finally he looks up and says,
&lsquo;Eva, you was right and I was wrong.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean, Jim?&rsquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I mean you was right when you thought we'd better
not get married, and I was wrong,&rsquo; says he; and he spoke
terrible bitter and sad. I never heard him speak like it. He sounded
like another man. I jest flung down my sewin' and went over to him,
and leaned his poor head against my shoulder. &lsquo;Jim,&rsquo; says
I, &lsquo;I 'ain't never regretted it.&rsquo;  And God knows I spoke
the truth, and I speak the truth when I say it now. I 'ain't never
regretted it, and I don't regret it now.&rdquo;  Eva said the last
with a look as if she were hurling defiance, then she went on in the
same high, monotonous key above the ordinary key of life. &ldquo;When
I says that, he jest gives a great sigh and sort of pushes me away
and gets up. &lsquo;Well, I have,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;I have, and
sometimes I think the best thing I can do is to take myself out of
the way, instead of sittin' here day after day and seein' you wearin'
your fingers to the bone to support me, and seein' my child, an'
bein' ashamed to look her in the face. Sometimes I think you an'
Amabel would be a damned sight better off without me than with me,
and I'm done for anyway, and it don't make much difference what I do
next.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jim Tenny, you jest quit talkin' in such a way as
this,&rsquo; says I, for I thought he meant to make away with
himself, but that wa'n't what he meant. Aggie Bemis had been windin'
her net round him, and he wa'n't nothin' but a man, and all
discouraged, and he gave in. Any man would in his place. He ain't to
blame. It's the tyrants that's over us all that's to blame.&rdquo;
Eva's voice shrilled higher. &ldquo;Curse them!&rdquo; she shrieked.
&ldquo;Curse them all!&mdash;every rich man in this gold-ridden
country!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva Tenny, you're beside yourself,&rdquo; said Fanny, who
was herself white to her lips, yet she viewed her sister indignantly,
as one violent nature will view another when it is overborne and
carried away by a kindred passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder if you'd be real calm in my place?&rdquo; said Eva;
and as she spoke the dreadful impassibility of desperation returned
upon her. It was as if she suffered some chemical change before their
eyes. She became silent and seemed as if she would never speak
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hadn't ought to talk so,&rdquo; said Fanny, weakly, she
was so terrified. &ldquo;You ought to think of poor little
Amabel,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>With that, Eva's dreadful, expressionless eyes turned towards
Amabel, and she held out her hand to her, but the child fairly
screamed with terror and clung to Ellen. &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Eva, don't
look at her so, you frighten her,&rdquo; Ellen said, trembling, and
leaning her cheek against Amabel's little, cold, pale one.
&ldquo;Don't cry, darling,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It is just
because poor mother feels so badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid of my mamma, and I want papa!&rdquo; screamed
Amabel, quivering, and stiffening her slender back.</p>

<p>Eva continued to keep her eyes fixed upon her, and to hold out
that commanding hand.</p>

<p>Fanny went close to her, seized her by both shoulders, and shook
her violently. &ldquo;Eva Tenny, you behave yourself!&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;There ain't no need of your acting this way if your man
has run away with another woman, and as for that child goin' with
you, she sha'n't go one step with any woman that looks and acts as
you do. Actin' this way over a good-for-nothin' fellow like Jim
Tenny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again that scourge of the spirit aroused Eva to her normal state.
She became a living, breathing, wrathful, loving woman once more.
&ldquo;Don't you dare say a word against Jim!&rdquo; she cried out;
&ldquo;not one word, Fanny Brewster; I won't hear it. Don't you dare
say a word!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you say a word against my papa!&rdquo; shrilled
Amabel. Then she left Ellen and ran to her mother, and clung to her.
And Eva caught her up, and hugged the little, fragile thing against
her breast, and pounced upon her with kisses, with a fury as of rage
instead of love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She always looked like Jim,&rdquo; she sobbed out;
&ldquo;she always did. Aggie Bemis shall never get her. I've got her
in spite of all the awful wrong of life; it's the good that had to
come out of it whether or no, and God couldn't help Himself. I've got
this much. She always looked like Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva set Amabel down and began leading her out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain't goin'?&rdquo; said Fanny, who had herself begun
to weep. &ldquo;Eva, you ain't goin'? Oh, you poor girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't!&mdash;you said that like Jim,&rdquo; Eva cried, with
a great groan of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva, you ain't goin'? Wait a little while, and let me do
somethin' for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can't do anything. Come, Amabel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eva and Amabel went away, the child rolling eyes of terror and
interrogation at them, Eva impervious to all her sister's
pleading.</p>

<p>When Andrew heard what had happened, and Fanny repeated what Eva
had said, his blame for Jim Tenny was unqualified. &ldquo;I've had a
hard time enough, knocked about from pillar to post, and I know what
she means when she talks about a checker-board. God knows I feel
myself sometimes as if I wasn't anything but a checker-piece instead
of a man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it's all nonsense blamin' the
shoe-manufacturers for his runnin' away with that woman. A man has
got to use what little freedom he's got right. It ain't any excuse
for Jim Tenny that he's been out of work and got discouraged. He's a
good-for-nothing cur, an' I'd like to tell him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won't do for you to talk to Eva that way,&rdquo; said
Fanny. They were all at the supper-table. Ellen was listening
silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does right to stand up for her husband, I
suppose,&rdquo; said Andrew, &ldquo;but anybody's got to use a little
sense. It don't make it any better for Jim, tryin' to shove blame off
his shoulders that belongs there. The manufacturers didn't make him
run off with another woman and leave his child. That was a move he
made himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he wouldn't have made that move if the manufacturers
hadn't made theirs,&rdquo; Ellen said, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>Andrew looked uneasily at Ellen, in whose cheeks two red spots
were burning, and whose eyes upon his face seemed narrowed to two
points of brightness. &ldquo;There's nothing for you to worry about,
child,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>All this was before the dressmaker, who listened with no
particular interest. Affairs which did not directly concern her did
not awaken her to much sharpness of regard. She had been forced by
circumstances into a very narrow groove of life, a little foot-path
as it were, fenced in from destruction by three dollars a day. She
could not, view it as keenly as she might, see that Jim Tenny's
elopement had anything whatever to do with her three dollars per day.
She, therefore, ate her supper. At first Andrew had looked warningly
at Fanny when she began to discuss the subject before the dressmaker,
but Fanny had replied, &ldquo;Oh, land, Andrew, she knows all about
it now. It's all over town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard it this morning before I came,&rdquo; said the
dressmaker. &ldquo;I think a puff on the sleeves of the silk waist
will be very pretty, don't you, Mrs. Brewster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked at the dressmaker with wonder; it seemed to her that
the woman was going on a little especial side track of her own
outside the interests of her kind. She looked at her pretty new
things and tried them on, and felt guilty that she had them. What
business had she having new clothes and going to Vassar College in
the face of that misery? What was an education? What was anything
compared with the sympathy which love demanded of love in the midst
of sorrow? Should she not turn her back upon any purely personal
advantage as she would upon a moral plague?</p>

<p>When Ellen's father said that to her at the supper-table she
looked at him with unchildlike eyes. &ldquo;I think it is something
for me to worry about, father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How can I help
worrying if I love Aunt Eva and Amabel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a dreadful thing for Eva,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I
don't see what she is going to do. Andrew, pass the biscuits to Miss
Higgins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that the one that is the farthest behind
anything that happens on this earth is the one to blame,&rdquo; said
Ellen, reverting to her line of argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know but you've got to go back to God, then,&rdquo;
said Andrew, soberly, passing the biscuits. Miss Higgins took
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you haven't,&rdquo; said Ellen&mdash;&ldquo;you
haven't, because men are free. You've got to stop before you get to
God. When a man goes wrong, you have got to look and see if he is to
blame, if he started himself, or other men have been pushing him into
it. It seems to me that other men have been pushing Uncle Jim into
it. I don't think factory-owners have any right to discharge a man
without a good reason, any more than he has a right to run the
shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think so, either,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I think
Ellen is right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know. It is all a puzzle,&rdquo; said Andrew.
&ldquo;Something's wrong somewhere. I don't know whether it's because
we are pushed or because we pull. There's no use in your worrying
about it, Ellen. You've got to study your books.&rdquo;  Andrew said
this with a look of pride at Ellen and sidelong triumph at the
dressmaker to see if she rightly understood the magnitude of it all,
of the whole situation of making dresses for this wonderful young
creature who was going to Vassar College.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know but this is more important than books,&rdquo;
said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe you'll find out something in your books that will
settle the whole matter,&rdquo; said Andrew. Ellen was not eating
much supper, and that troubled him. Andrew always knew just how much
Ellen ate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what Aunt Eva and poor little Amabel will
do,&rdquo; said she. Ellen's lip quivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pass the cake to Miss Higgins,&rdquo; said Fanny, sharply,
to Andrew. She gave him a significant wink as she did so, not to talk
more about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try some of that chocolate cake, Miss Higgins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Miss Higgins, unexcitedly.</p>

<p>Andrew had his own cause of worry, and finally reverted to it,
eating his food with no more conception of the savor than if it were
in another man's mouth. He was sorry enough for his wife's sister,
and recognized it as an added weight to his own burden, but just at
present all he could think of was the question if Miss Higgins would
ask for her pay again that night. He had not a dollar in his pocket.
He had been dunned that afternoon by the man who had lent the money
to buy Ellen's watch, there were two new dunning letters in his
pocket, and now if that keen little dressmaker, who fairly looked to
him like a venomous insect, as she sat eating rather voraciously of
the chocolate cake, should ask him again for the three dollars due
her that night! He would not have cared so much, if it were not for
the fact that she would ask him before his wife and Ellen, and the
question about the money in the savings-bank, which was a species of
nightmare to him, would be sure to come to the front.</p>

<p>Suddenly it struck Andrew that he might run away, that he might
slip out after supper, and either go into his mother's house or down
the street. He finally decided on the former, since he reasoned, with
a pitiful cunning, that if he went down the street he would have to
take off his slippers and put on his shoes, and that would at once
betray him and lead to the possible arrest of his flight.</p>

<p>So after supper, while Miss Higgins was trying a waist on Ellen,
and Fanny was clearing the table, Andrew, bareheaded and in his
slippers, prepared to carry his plan into execution. He got out
without being seen, and hurried around the rear of the house, out of
view from the sitting-room windows, resolving on the way that in
order to avert the danger of a possible following him to the
sanctuary of his mother's house, he had perhaps better slip down into
the orchard behind it and see if the porter apples were ripe. But
when, stooping as if beneath some invisible shield, and moving with a
low glide of secrecy, he had gained the yard between the two houses,
the yard where the three cherry-trees stood, he heard Fanny's high,
insistent voice calling him, and knew that it was all over. Fanny had
her head thrust out of her bedroom window. &ldquo;Andrew!
Andrew!&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>Andrew stopped. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, in a gruff
voice. He felt at that moment savage with her and with fate. He felt
like some badgered animal beneath the claws and teeth of petty
enemies which were yet sufficient to do him to death. He felt that
retreat and defence were alike impossible and inglorious. He was
aware of a monstrous impatience with it all, which was fairly
blasphemy. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, and Fanny realized that
something was wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Andrew Brewster,&rdquo; she said, from the
bedroom window, and Andrew pressed close to the window through a
growth of sweetbrier which rasped his hands and sent up a sweet
fragrance in his face. Andrew tore away the clinging vines
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; he said again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't spoil that bush, Ellen sets a lot by it,&rdquo; said
Fanny. &ldquo;What makes you act so, Andrew Brewster?&rdquo;  Then
she lowered her voice. &ldquo;She wants to know if she can have her
pay to-night,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'ain't got a cent,&rdquo; replied Andrew, in a dogged,
breathless voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You 'ain't been to the bank to-day, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I 'ain't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny still suspected nothing. She was, in fact, angry with the
dressmaker for insisting upon her pay in such a fashion. &ldquo;I
never heard of such a thing as her wantin' to be paid every
night,&rdquo; she whispered, angrily, &ldquo;and I'd tell her so, if
I wasn't afraid she'd think we couldn't pay her. I'd never have had
her; I'd had Miss Patch, if I'd know she'd do such a mean thing, but,
as it is, I don't know what to do. I 'ain't got but a dollar and
seventy-three cents by me. You 'ain't got enough to make it
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I 'ain't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all is, I've got to tell her that it ain't convenient
for me to pay her to-night, and she shall have it all together
to-morrow night, and to-morrow you'll have to go to the bank and take
out the money, Andrew. Don't forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>Fanny retreated, and he heard her high voice explaining to Miss
Higgins. He tore his way through the clinging sweetbrier bushes and
ran with an unsteady, desperate gait down to the orchard behind his
mother's home, and flung himself at full length in the dewy grass
under the trees with all the abandon, under stress of fate, of a
child.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXVIII</h3>

<p>Andrew Brewster, lying in the dewy grass under the apple-trees,
giving way for almost the first time since his childhood to impulses
which had hitherto, from his New England heredity, stiffened instead
of relaxed his muscles of expression, felt as if he were being stung
to death by ants. He was naturally a man of broad views, who felt the
indignity of coping with such petty odds. &ldquo;For God's sake, if I
had to be done to death, why couldn't it have been for
something?&rdquo; he groaned, speaking with his lips close to the
earth as if it were a listening ear. &ldquo;Why need it all have been
over so little? It's just the little fight for enough to eat and wear
that's getting the better of me that was a man, and able to do a
man's work in the world. Now it has come to this! Here I am runnin'
away from a woman because she wants me to pay her three dollars, and
I am afraid of another woman because&mdash;I've been and fooled away
a few hundred dollars I had in the savings-bank. I'm
afraid&mdash;yes, it has come to this. I am afraid, afraid, and I'd
run away out of life if I knew where it would fetch me to. I'm afraid
of things that ain't worth being afraid of, and it's all over things
that's beneath me.&rdquo;  There came over Andrew, with his mouth to
the moist earth, feeling the breath and the fragrance of it in his
nostrils, a realization of the great motherhood of nature, and a
contempt for himself which was scorching and scathing before it. He
felt that he came from that mighty breast which should produce only
sons of might, and was spending his whole life in an ignominy of
fruitless climbing up mole-hills. &ldquo;Why couldn't I have been
more?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Oh, my God, is it my
fault?&rdquo;  He said to himself that if he had not yielded to the
universal law and longing of his kind for a home and a family, it
might have been better. He asked himself that question which will
never be answered with a surety of correctness, whether the
advancement of the individual to his furthest compass is more to the
glory of life than the blind following out of the laws of existence
and the bringing others into the everlasting problem of advance. Then
he thought of Ellen, and a great warmth of conviction came over the
loving heart of the man; all his self-contempt vanished. He had her,
this child who was above pearls and rubies, he had her, and in her
the furthest reach of himself and progression of himself to greater
distances than he could ever have accomplished in any other way, and
it was a double progress, since it was not only for him, but also for
the woman he had married. A great wave of love for Fanny came over
him. He seemed to see that, after all, it was a shining road by which
he had come, and he saw himself upon it like a figure of light. He
saw that he lived and could never die. Then, as with a remorseless
hurl of a high spirit upon needle-pricks of petty cares, he thought
again of the dressmaker, of the money for Ellen's watch, of the
butcher's bill, and the grocer's bills, and the money which he had
taken from the bank, and again he cowered beneath and loathed his
ignoble burden. He dug his hot head into the grass. &ldquo;Oh, my
God! oh, my God!&rdquo; he groaned. He fairly sobbed. Then he felt a
soft wind of feminine skirts caused by the sudden stoop of some one
beside him, and Ellen's voice, shrill with alarm, rang in his ears.
&ldquo;Father, what is the matter? Father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the man's love for the girl that his first thought was
for her alarm, and he pushed all his own troubles into the background
with a lightning-like motion. He raised himself hastily, and smiled
at her with his pitiful, stiff face. &ldquo;It's nothing at all,
Ellen, don't you worry,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>But that was not enough to satisfy her. She caught hold of his arm
and clung to it. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, in a tone which had
in it, to his wonder, a firm womanliness&mdash;his own daughter
seemed to speak to him as if she were his mother&mdash;&ldquo;you are
not telling me the truth. Something is the matter, or you wouldn't do
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there's nothin', nothin' at all, dear child,&rdquo;
said Andrew. He tried to loosen her little, clinging hand from his
arm. &ldquo;Come, let's go back to the house,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Don't you mind anything about it. Sometimes father gets
discouraged over nothin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't over nothing,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;What is it
about, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew tried to laugh. &ldquo;Well, if it isn't over nothin', it's
over nothin' in particular,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it's over jest
what's happened right along. Sometimes father feels as if he hadn't
made as much as he'd ought to out of his life, and he's gettin'
older, and he's feelin' kind of discouraged, that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over money matters?&rdquo; said Ellen, looking at him
steadily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over nothin',&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;See here,
child, father's ashamed that he gave way so, and you found him. Now
don't you worry one mite about it&mdash;it's nothing at all. Come,
let's go back to the house,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Ellen said no more, but she walked up from the field holding
tightly to her father's poor, worn hand, and her heart was in a
tumult. To behold any convulsion of nature is no light experience,
and when it is a storm of the spirit in one beloved the beholder is
swept along with it in greater or less measure. Ellen trembled as she
walked. Her father kept looking at her anxiously and remorsefully.
Once he reached around his other hand and chucked her playfully under
the chin. &ldquo;Scared most to death, was she?&rdquo; he asked, with
a shamefaced blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know something is the matter, and I think it would be
better for you to tell me, father,&rdquo; replied Ellen, soberly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's nothing to tell, child,&rdquo; said Andrew.
&ldquo;Don't you worry your little head about it.&rdquo;  Between his
anxiety lest the girl should be troubled, and his intense humiliation
that she should have discovered him in such an abandon of grief which
was almost like a disclosure of the nakedness of his spirit, he was
completely unnerved. Ellen felt him tremble, and heard his voice
quiver when he spoke. She felt towards her father something she had
never felt before&mdash;an impulse of protection. She felt the older
and stronger of the two. Her grasp on his hand tightened, she seemed
in a measure to be leading him along.</p>

<p>When they reached the yard between the houses Andrew cast an
apprehensive glance at the windows. &ldquo;Has she gone?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, the dressmaker?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hadn't when I came out. I saw you come past the house,
and I thought you walked as if you didn't feel well, so I thought I
would run out and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was all right,&rdquo; replied Andrew. &ldquo;Have you got
to try on anything more to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let's run into grandma's a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes was sitting at her front window in the dusk, looking
out on the street, as was her favorite custom. The old woman seldom
lit a lamp in the summer evening, but sat there staring out at the
lighted street and the people passing and repassing, with her mind as
absolutely passive as regarded herself as if she were travelling and
observing only that which passed without. At those times she became
in a fashion sensible of the motion of the world, and lost her sense
of individuality in the midst of it. When her son and granddaughter
entered she looked away from the window with the expression of one
returning from afar, and seemed dazed for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, mother!&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>The room was dusky, and they moved across between the chairs and
tables like two shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it you, Andrew?&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;Who
is that with you&mdash;Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;How do you do,
grandma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes became suddenly fully awake to the situation; she
collected her scattered faculties; her keen old eyes gleamed in a
shaft of electric-light from the street without, which fell full upon
her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set down,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Has the dressmaker
gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she hadn't when I came out,&rdquo; replied Ellen,
&ldquo;but she's most through for to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do your things look?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Real pretty, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think you'd better have had Miss Patch. I hope
she 'ain't got your sleeves too tight at the elbows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seem to fit very nicely, grandma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleeves are very particular things; a sleeve wrong can
spoil a whole dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the old woman turned on Ellen with a look of extremest
facetiousness and intelligence, and the girl winced, for she knew
what was coming. &ldquo;I see you goin' past with a young man last
night, didn't I?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Ellen flushed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, almost indignantly,
for she had a feeling as if the veil of some inner sacredness of her
nature were continually being torn aside. &ldquo;I went over to Miss
Lennox, to carry some sweet-peas, and Mr. Robert Lloyd was there, and
he came home with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied her grandmother.</p>

<p>Ellen's patience left her at the sound of that &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
which seemed to rasp her very soul. &ldquo;You have none of you any
right to talk and act as you do,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You make me
ashamed of you, you and mother; father has more sense. Just because a
young man makes me a call to return something, and then walks home
with me, because he happened to be at the house where I call in the
evening! I think it's a shame. You make me feel as if I couldn't look
him in the face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, grandma didn't mean any harm,&rdquo; Andrew
said, soothingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn't try to excuse me, Andrew Brewster,&rdquo; cried
his mother, angrily. &ldquo;I guess it's a pretty to-do, if I can't
say a word in joke to my own granddaughter. If it had been a poor,
good-for-nothing young feller workin' in a shoe-factory, I s'pose
she'd been tickled to death to be joked about him, but now when it
begins to look as if somebody that was worth while had come
along&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandma, if you say another word about it, I will never
speak to Robert Lloyd again as long as I live,&rdquo; declared
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, child,&rdquo; whispered Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do mind, and I mean what I say,&rdquo; Ellen cried.
&ldquo;I won't have it. Robert Lloyd is nothing to me, and I am
nothing to him. He is no better than Granville Joy. There is nothing
between us, and you make me too ashamed to think of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the old woman cried out, in a tone of triumph, &ldquo;Well,
there he is, turnin' in at your gate now.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXIX</h3>

<p>Ellen rose without a word, and fled out of the room and out of the
house. It seemed to her, after what had happened, after what her
mother and grandmother had said and insinuated, after what she
herself had thought and felt, that she must. She longed to see Robert
Lloyd, to hear him speak, as she had never longed for anything in the
world, and yet she ran away as if she were driven to obey some law
which was coeval with the first woman and beyond all volition of her
individual self.</p>

<p>When she reached the head of the little cross street on which the
Atkinses lived, she turned into it with relief. The Atkins house was
a tiny cottage, with a little kitchen ell, and a sagging piazza
across the front. On this piazza were shadowy figures, and the dull,
red gleam of pipes, and one fiery tip of a cigar. Joe Atkins, and
Sargent, and two other men were sitting out there in the cool of the
evening. Ellen hurried around the curve of the foot-path to the
kitchen door. Abby was in there, working with the swift precision of
a machine. She washed and wiped dishes as if in a sort of fury, her
thin elbows jerking, her mouth compressed.</p>

<p>When Ellen entered, Abby stared, then her whole face lighted up,
as if from some internal lamp. &ldquo;Why, Ellen, is that you?&rdquo;
she said, in a surprisingly sweet voice. Sometimes Abby's sharp
American voice rang with the sweetness of a soft bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I'd run over a minute,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>The other girl looked sharply at her. &ldquo;Why, what's the
matter?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is the matter. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you looked sort of queer. Maybe it's the
light. Sit down; I'll have the dishes done in a minute, then we'll go
into the sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd rather stay out here with you,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Abby looked at her again. &ldquo;There is something the matter,
Ellen Brewster,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you can't cheat me. You would
never have run over here this way in the world. What has
happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's go up to your room after the dishes are done, and
then I'll tell you,&rdquo; whispered Ellen. The men's voices on the
piazza could be heard quite distinctly, and it seemed possible that
their own conversation might be overheard in return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;Of course I have heard
about your aunt,&rdquo; she added, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen, and she felt shamed and remorseful
that her own affairs had been uppermost in her mind, and that Abby
had supposed that she might be disturbed over this great trouble of
her poor aunt's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is dreadful,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;I wish I
could get hold of that woman.&rdquo;  By &ldquo;that woman&rdquo; she
meant the woman with whom poor Jim Tenny had eloped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Ellen, bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it's something besides that made you run over
here,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you when we go up to your room,&rdquo; replied
Ellen.</p>

<p>When the dishes were finished, and the two girls in Abby's little
chamber, seated side by side on the bed, Ellen still hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Ellen Brewster, what is the matter? You said you would
tell, and you've got to,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>Ellen looked away from her, blushing. The electric-light from the
street shone full in the room, which was wavering with grotesque
shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I ran away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ran away! What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, because.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I saw somebody coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saw who coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Granville Joy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked straight ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not young Mr. Lloyd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen was silent with the silence of assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he go into your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In grandma's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you ran away, over here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ellen Brewster, didn't you want to see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen turned from Abby with an impatient gesture, buried her face
in the bed, and began to weep.</p>

<p>Abby leaned over her caressingly. &ldquo;Ellen dear,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;what is the matter; what are you crying for? What
made you run away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen sobbed harder.</p>

<p>Abby looked at Ellen's prostrate figure sadly.
&ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; she began; then she stopped, for her own voice
quivered. Then she went on, quite steadily. &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;you like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; declared Ellen. &ldquo;I won't. I never
will. Nothing shall make me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Abby continued to look at her sadly and jealously.
&ldquo;There's a power over us which is too strong for girls,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;and you've come under it, Ellen, and you can't help
it.&rdquo;  Then she added, with a great, noble burst of utter
unselfishness: &ldquo;And I'm glad, I'm glad, Ellen. That man can
lift you out of the grind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen sat up straight and faced her, with burning cheeks, and
eyes shining through tears. &ldquo;I will never be lifted out of the
grind as long as those I love are in it,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it would make it any better for your folks
to see you in it all your life along with them?&rdquo; said Abby.
&ldquo;Suppose you married a fellow like Granville Joy?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXX</h3>

<p>Ellen looked at the other girl in a kind of rage of maidenly
shame. &ldquo;Why have I got to get married, anyway?&rdquo; she
demanded. &ldquo;Isn't there anything in this world besides getting
married? Why do you all talk so about me? You don't seem so bent on
getting married yourself. If you think so much of marriage, why don't
you get married yourself, and let me alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody wants to marry me that I know of,&rdquo; replied
Abby, quite simply. Then she, too, blazed out. &ldquo;Get
married!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Do you really think I would get
married to the kind of man who would marry me? Do you think I could
if I loved him?&rdquo;  A great wave of red surged over the girl's
thin face, her voice trembled with tenderness. Ellen knew at once,
with a throb of sympathy and shame, that Abby did love some one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would marry him if I loved him?&rdquo;
demanded Abby, stiffening herself into a soldier-like straightness.
&ldquo;Do you think? I tell you what it is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
was lookin' only to-day at David Mendon at the cutting-bench, cutting
away with his poor little knife. I'd like to know how many handles
he's worn out since he began. There he was, putting the pattern on
the leather, and cuttin' around it, standin' at his window, that's a
hot place in summer and a cold one in winter, and there's where he's
stood for I don't know how many years since before I was born. He's
one of the few that Lloyd's has hung on to when he's got older, and I
thought to myself, good Lord, how that poor man must have loved his
wife, and how he must love his children, to be willin' to turn
himself into a machine like that for them. He never takes a holiday
unless he's forced into it; there he stands and cuts and cuts. If I
were his wife, I would die of shame and pity that I ever led him into
it. Do you think I would ever let a man turn himself into a machine
for me, if I loved him? I guess I wouldn't! And that's why, when I
see a man of another sort that you won't have to break your own heart
over, whether you marry him or not, payin' attention to you, I am
glad. It's a different thing, marriage with a man like Robert Lloyd,
and a man like that would never think of me. I'm right in the ranks,
and you ain't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Ellen, stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you ain't; you don't belong there, and when I see a
chance for you to get out where you belong&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't intend to make marriage a stepping-stone,&rdquo;
said Ellen. &ldquo;Sometimes&mdash;&rdquo;  She hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the other girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think I would rather not go to college, after
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen Brewster, are you crazy? Of course, you will go to
college unless you marry Robert Lloyd. Perhaps he won't want to
wait.&rdquo;  Then Abby, dauntless as she was, shrank a little before
Ellen's wrathful retort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abby Atkins, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;There he's been to see me just twice, the first
time on an errand, and the next with his aunt, and he's walked home
with me once because he couldn't help it; his aunt told him
to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But here he is again to-night,&rdquo; said Abby,
apologetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of that? I suppose he has come on another
errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what made you run away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you have all made me ashamed of my life to look at
him,&rdquo; said Ellen, hotly.</p>

<p>Then down went her head on the bed again, and Abby was leaning
over her, caressing her, whispering fond things to her like a
lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, Ellen,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Don't be
mad, don't feel bad. I didn't mean any harm. You are such a
beauty&mdash;there's nobody like you in the world&mdash;that
everybody thinks that any man who sees you must want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert Lloyd doesn't, and if he did I wouldn't have
him,&rdquo; sobbed Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sha'n't if you don't want him,&rdquo; said Abby,
consolingly.</p>

<p>After a while the two girls bathed their eyes with cold water, and
went down-stairs into the sitting-room. Maria was making herself a
blue muslin dress, and her mother was hemming the ruffles. There was
a cheap blue shade on the lamp, and Maria herself was clad in a blue
gingham. All the blue color and the shade on the lamp gave a curious
pallor and unreality to the homely room and the two women. Mrs.
Atkins's hair was strained back from her hollow temples, which had
noble outlines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going to walk a little way with Ellen, she's going
home,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said her mother. Maria looked wistfully
at them as they went out. She went on sewing on her blue muslin,
rather sadly. She coughed a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you put up your sewing for to-night and go to
bed, child?&rdquo; said her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might as well sit here and sew as go to bed and lie
there. I shouldn't sleep,&rdquo; replied Maria, with the gentlest
sadness conceivable. There was in it no shadow of complaining. Of
late years all the fire of resistance had seemed to die out in the
girl. She was unfailingly sweet, but nerveless. Often when she raised
a hand it seemed as if she could not even let it fall, as if it must
remain poised by some curious inertia. Still, she went to the shop
every day and did her work faithfully. She pasted linings in shoes,
and her slender little fingers used to fly as if they were driven by
some more subtle machine than any in the factory. Often Maria felt
vaguely as if she were in the grasp of some mighty machine worked by
a mighty operator; she felt, as she pasted the linings, as if she
herself were also a part of some monstrous scheme of work under
greater hands than hers, and there was never any getting back of it.
And always with it all there was that ceaseless, helpless, bewildered
longing for something, she was afraid to think what, which often saps
the strength and life of a young girl. Maria had never had a lover in
her life; she had not even good comrades among young men, as her
sister had. No man at that time would have ever looked twice at her,
unless he had fallen in love with her, and had been disposed to pick
her up and carry her along on the hard road upon which they fared
together. Maria was half fed in every sense; she had not enough
nourishing food for her body, nor love for her heart, nor exercise
for her brain. She had no time to read, as she was forced to sew when
out of the shop if she would have anything to wear. When at last she
went up-stairs to bed, before Abby returned, she sat down by her
window, and leaned her little, peaked chin on the sill and looked
out. The stars were unusually bright for a summer night; the whole
sky seemed filled with a constantly augmenting host of them. The
scent of tobacco came to her from below. To the lonely girl the stars
and the scent of the tobacco served as stimulants; she formed a
forcible wish. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she muttered to herself,
&ldquo;that I was either an angel or a man.&rdquo;  Then the next
minute she chided herself for her wickedness. A great wave of love
for God, and remorse for impatience and melancholy in her earthly
lot, swept over her. She knelt down beside her bed and prayed. An
exultation half-physical, half-spiritual, filled her. When she rose,
her little, thin face was radiant. She seemed to measure the
shortness of the work and woe of the world as between her thumb and
finger. The joy of the divine filled all her longing. When Abby came
home, who shared her chamber, she felt no jealousy. She only inquired
whether she had gone quite home with Ellen. &ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo;
replied Abby. &ldquo;I don't think it is safe for her to go past that
lonely place below the Smiths'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm glad you did,&rdquo; said Maria, with an angelic
inflection in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert Lloyd came to see Ellen, and she ran away over here,
and wouldn't see him, because they had all been plaguing her about
him,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;I wish she wouldn't do so. It would be
a splendid thing for her to marry him, and I know he likes her, and
his aunt is going to send her to college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won't make any difference to Ellen, and everything
will be all right anyway, if only she loved God,&rdquo; said Maria,
still with that rapt, angelic voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; said Abby. Then she leaned over her sister,
caught her by her little, thin shoulders and shook her tenderly.
&ldquo;There, I didn't mean to speak so,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;You're awful good, Maria. I'm glad you've got religion if it's
so much comfort to you. I don't mean to make light of it, but I'm
afraid you ain't well. I'm goin' to get you some more of that tonic
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXI</h3>

<p>When Ellen reached home that night she found no one there except
her father, who was sitting on the door-step in the north yard. Her
mother had gone to see her aunt Eva as soon as the dressmaker had
left. &ldquo;Who was that with you?&rdquo; Andrew asked, as she drew
near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abby,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you went over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen sat down on a lower step in front of her father.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she. She half laughed up in his face, like a
child who knows she has been naughty, yet knows she will not be
blamed since she can count so surely on the indulgent love of the
would-be blamer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, your mother didn't like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had said so many things to me about him that I didn't
feel as if I could see him, father,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Andrew put a hand on her head. &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;but they didn't mean any harm; they're only
looking out for your best good, Ellen. You can't always have us; it
ain't in the course of nature, you know, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a tone of inexorable sadness, the sadness of fate itself
in Andrew's voice. He had, as he spoke, the full realization of that
stage of progress which is simply for the next, which passes to make
room for it. He felt his own nothingness. It was the throe of the
present before the future; it was the pang of anticipatory
annihilation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't talk that way, father,&rdquo; said Ellen.
&ldquo;Neither you nor mother are old people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it's all right, don't you worry,&rdquo; said
Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long did he stay?&rdquo; asked Ellen. She did not look
at her father as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he didn't stay at all, after they found out you had
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen sighed. After a second Andrew sighed also. &ldquo;It's
gettin' late,&rdquo; said he, heavily; &ldquo;mebbe we'd better go in
before your mother comes, Ellen. Mebbe you'll get cold out
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I shall not,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;and I want to
hear about poor Aunt Eva. I don't see what she is going to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a dreadful thing makin' a mistake in marriage,&rdquo;
said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Jim was a good man if he hadn't had such a hard
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew looked at her, then he spoke impressively. &ldquo;Look
here, Ellen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a good scholar, and you
are smarter in a good many ways than father has ever been, but
there's one thing you want to remember; you want to be sure before
you blame the Lord or other men for a man's goin' wrong, if it ain't
his own fault at the bottom of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's mother,&rdquo; cried Ellen; &ldquo;there's mother
and Amabel. Where's Aunt Eva? Oh, father, what do you suppose has
happened? Why do you suppose mother is bringing Amabel
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Andrew, in a troubled
voice.</p>

<p>He and Ellen rose and hastened forward to meet Fanny and Amabel.
The child hung at her aunt's hand in a curious, limp, disjointed
fashion; her little face, even in the half light, showed ghastly.
When she saw Ellen she let go of Fanny's hand and ran to her and
threw both her little arms around her in a fierce clutch as of
terror, then she began to sob wildly, &ldquo;Mamma, mamma,
mamma!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny leaned her drawn face forward, and whispered to Andrew and
Ellen over Amabel's head, under cover of her sobs, &ldquo;Hush, don't
say anything. She's gone mad, and, and&mdash;she tried to&mdash;kill
Amabel.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXII</h3>

<p>Amabel was a very nervous child, and she was in such terror from
her really terrific experience that she threatened to go into
convulsions. Andrew went over for his mother, whom he had always
regarded as an incontestable authority about children. She, after one
sharp splutter of wrath at the whole situation, went to work with the
resolution of an old soldier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heat some water, quick,&rdquo; said she to Andrew,
&ldquo;and get me a wash-tub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she told Fanny to brew a mess of sage tea, and began
stripping off Amabel's clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me alone! Mamma, mamma, mamma!&rdquo; shrieked the
child. She fought and clawed like a little, wild animal, but the old
woman, in whose arms great strength could still arise for
emergencies, and in whose spirit great strength had never died, got
the better of her.</p>

<p>When Amabel's clothing was stripped off, and her little, spare
body, which was brown rather than rosy, although she was a blonde,
was revealed, she was as pitiful to see as a wound. Every nerve and
pulse in that tiny frame, about which there was not an ounce of
superfluous flesh, seemed visible. The terrible sensitiveness of the
child appeared on the surface. She shrank, and wailed in a low,
monotonous tone like a spent animal overtaken by pursuers. But Mrs.
Zelotes put her in the tub of warm water, and held her down, though
Amabel's face, emerging from it, had the expression of a wild
thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, you keep still!&rdquo; said she, and her voice was
tender enough, though the decision of it could have moved an
army.</p>

<p>When Amabel had had her hot bath, and had drunk her sage tea by
compulsory gulps, and been tucked into Ellen's bed, her childhood
reasserted itself. Gradually her body and her bodily needs gained the
ascendancy over the unnatural strain of her mind. She fell asleep,
and lay like one dead. Then Ellen crept down-stairs, though it was
almost midnight, where her father and mother and grandmother were
still talking over the matter. Fanny seemed almost as bad as her
sister. It was evident that there was in the undisciplined Loud
family a dangerous strain if too far pressed. She was lying down on
the lounge, with Andrew holding her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Poor Eva!&rdquo; she kept
repeating.</p>

<p>Then she threw off Andrew's hand, sprang to her feet, and began to
walk the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She'll be as bad as her sister if she keeps on,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Zelotes, quite audibly, but Fanny paid no attention to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is goin' to be done? Oh, my God, what is goin' to be
done?&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;There she is locked up with two men
watchin' her lest she do herself a harm, and it's got to cost
eighteen dollars a week, unless she's put in with the State poor, and
then nobody knows how she'll be treated. Oh, poor Eva, poor Eva!
Albert Riggs told me there were awful things done with the State poor
in the asylums. He's been an attendant in one. He says we've got to
pay eighteen dollars a week if we want to have her cared for
decently, and where's the money comin' from?&rdquo; Fanny raised her
voice higher still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's the money comin' from?&rdquo; she demanded, with an
impious inflection. It was as if she questioned that which is outside
of, and the source of, life. Everything with this woman, whose whole
existence had been bound and tainted by the need of money, resolved
itself into that fundamental question. All her woes hinged upon it;
even her misery was deteriorated by mammon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's the money comin' from?&rdquo; she demanded again.
&ldquo;There's Jim gone, and all his mother's got is that little,
mortgaged place, and she feeble, and there ain't a cent anywhere,
unless&mdash;&rdquo;  She turned fiercely to Andrew, clutching him
hard by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take every cent of that money out of the
savings-bank,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;every cent of it. I'm your
wife, and I've been a good wife to you, you can't say I
haven't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course you have, poor girl! Don't, don't!&rdquo;
said Andrew, soothingly. He was very pale, and shook from head to
foot as he tried to calm Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I've been a good, faithful wife,&rdquo; Fanny went on,
in her high, hysterical voice. &ldquo;Even your mother can't say that
I haven't; and Eva is my own sister, and you ought to help her. Every
cent of that money will have to come out of the savings-bank, and the
house here will have to be mortgaged; it's only my due. I would do as
much for you if it was your sister. Eva ain't goin' to
suffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess if you mortgage this house that you had from your
father, to keep a woman whose husband has gone off and left
her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, &ldquo;I guess if you don't go and get
him back, and get the law to tackle him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Fanny turned on her. &ldquo;Don't you say a word,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;My sister ain't goin' to suffer, I don't care where the
money comes from. It's mine as much as Andrew's. I've half supported
the family myself sewin' on wrappers, and I've got a right to have my
say. My sister ain't goin' to suffer! Oh, my God, what's goin' to
become of her? Poor Eva, poor Eva! Eighteen dollars a week; that's as
much as Andrew ever earned. Oh, it was awful, it was awful! There,
when I got in there, she had a&mdash;knife, the&mdash;carving knife,
and she had Amabel's hair all gathered up in one hand, and her head
tipped back, and poor old mother Tenny was holding her arms, and
screamin', and it was all I could do to get the knife away,&rdquo;
and Fanny stripped up her sleeves, and showed a glancing cut on her
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did that before I got it away from her,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Think of it, my own sister! My own sister, who always
thought so much of me, and would have had her own fingers cut to the
bone before she would have let any one touch me or Ellen! Oh, poor
Eva, poor Eva! What is goin' to become of her, what is goin' to
become of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes went out of the house with a jerk of angry decision,
and presently returned with a bottle half full of whiskey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said she to Ellen, &ldquo;you pour out a
quarter of a tumbler of this, and fill it up with hot water. I ain't
goin' to have the whole family in an asylum because Jim Tenny has run
off with another woman, if I can help it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman's steady force of will asserted itself over the
hysterical nature of her daughter-in-law. Fanny drank the whiskey and
water and went to bed, half stupefied, and Mrs. Zelotes went
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ring the bell in the night if she's taken worse, and
I'll come over,&rdquo; said she to her son.</p>

<p>When Ellen and her father were left alone they looked at each
other, each with pity for the other. Andrew laid a tender, trembling
hand on the girl's shoulder. &ldquo;Somehow it will all come out
right,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You go to bed and go to sleep, and
if Amabel wakes up and makes any trouble you speak to
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't worry about me, father,&rdquo; returned Ellen.
&ldquo;It's you who have the most to worry over.&rdquo;  Then she
added&mdash;for the canker of need of money was eating her soul,
too&mdash;&ldquo;Father, what is going to be done? You can't pay all
that for poor Aunt Eva. How much money have you got in the
bank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, not much, Ellen,&rdquo; replied Andrew, with a
groan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn't last very long at eighteen dollars a
week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't seem as if you ought to mortgage the house when
you and mother are getting older. Father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Ellen, after a little pause. It had
been on her lips to tell him that she must go to work, then she
refrained. There was something in her father's face which forbade her
doing so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to bed, Ellen, and get rested,&rdquo; said Andrew. Then
he rubbed his head against hers with his curious, dog-like method of
caress, and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go to sleep and get rested yourself, father,&rdquo;
said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I won't undress to-night, but I'll lay on the
lounge,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you speak to me if mother wakes up and takes on
again. Maybe I can do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, dear child,&rdquo; said Andrew, lovingly and
wearily. He had a look as if some mighty wind had passed over him and
he were beaten down under it, except for that one single uprearing of
love which no tempest could fairly down.</p>

<p>Ellen went up-stairs, and lay down beside poor little Amabel
without undressing herself. The child stirred, but not to awake, when
she settled down beside her, and reached over her poor little claw of
a hand to the girl, who clasped it fervently, and slipped a
protecting arm under the tiny shoulders. Then the little thing
nestled close to Ellen, with a movement of desperate seeking for
protection. &ldquo;There, there, darling, Ellen will take care of
you,&rdquo; whispered Ellen. But Amabel did not hear.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXIII</h3>

<p>The next afternoon poor Eva Tenny was carried away, and Andrew
accompanied the doctor who had her in charge, as being the only
available male relative. As he dressed himself in his Sunday suit, he
was aware&mdash;to such pitiful passes had financial straits brought
him&mdash;of a certain self-congratulation, that he would not be at
home when the dressmaker asked for money that night, and that no one
would expect him to go to the bank under such circumstances. But
Andrew, in his petty consideration as to personal benefit from such
dire calamity, reckoned without another narrow traveller. Miss
Higgins stopped him as he was going out of the door, looking as if
bound to a funeral in his shabby Sunday black, with his solemn, sad
face under his well-brushed hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to say anything when you're in such trouble, Mr.
Brewster,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I do need the money to pay a
bill, and I was wondering if you could leave what was due me
yesterday, and what will be due me to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Fanny came with a rush to Andrew's relief. She was in that
state of nervous tension that she was fairly dangerous if irritated.
&ldquo;Look here, Miss Higgins,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;We hesitated
a good deal about havin' you come here to-day, anyway. Ellen wanted
to send you word not to. We are in such awful trouble, that she said
it didn't seem right for her to be thinkin' about new clothes, but I
told her she'd got to have the things if she was going to college,
and so we decided to have you come, but we 'ain't had any time nor
any heart to think of money. We've got plenty to pay you in the bank,
but my husband 'ain't had any time to go there this mornin', what
with seein' the doctor, and gettin' the certificate for my poor
sister, and all I've got to say is: if you're so dreadful afraid as
all this comes to, that you have to lose all sense of decency, and
dun folks so hard, in such trouble as we be, you can put on your
things and go jest as quick as you have a mind to, and I'll get Miss
Patch to finish the work. I've been more than half a mind to have
her, anyway. I was very strongly advised to. Lots of folks have
talked to me against your fittin', but I've always had you, and I
thought I'd give you the chance. Now if you don't want it, you jest
pack up and go, and the quicker the better. You shall have your pay
as soon as Mr. Brewster can get round after he has carried my poor
sister to the asylum. You needn't worry.&rdquo;  Fanny said the last
with a sarcasm which seemed to reach out with a lash of bitterness
like a whip. The other woman winced, her eyes were hard, but her
voice was appeasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I didn't think you'd take it so, Mrs. Brewster, or I
wouldn't have said anything,&rdquo; she almost wheedled. &ldquo;You
know I ain't afraid of not gettin' my pay, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better not be,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I ain't. I know Mr. Brewster has steady work, and
I know your folks have got money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've got money enough not to be beholden to
anybody,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;Andrew, you'd better be goin'
along or you'll be late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew went out of the yard with his head bent miserably. He had
felt ashamed of his fear, he felt still more ashamed of his relief.
He wondered, going down the street, if it might not be a happier lot
to lose one's wits like poor Eva, rather than have them to the full
responsibility of steering one's self through such straits of
misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you won't think I meant any harm,&rdquo; the
dressmaker said to Fanny, quite humbly.</p>

<p>There was that about the sister of another woman who was being
carried off to an insane asylum which was fairly intimidating.</p>

<p>Miss Higgins sewed meekly during the remainder of the day, having
all the time a wary eye upon Fanny. She went home before supper,
urging a headache as an excuse. She was in reality afraid of
Fanny.</p>

<p>Andrew was inexpressibly relieved when he reached home to find
that the dressmaker was gone, and Fanny, having sent Amabel to bed,
was chiefly anxious to know how her sister had reached the asylum. It
was not until the latter part of the evening that she brought up the
subject of the bank. &ldquo;Do look out to-morrow, Andrew Brewster,
and be sure to take that money out of the bank to pay Miss
Higgins,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As for being dunned again by that
woman, I won't! It's the last time I'll ever have her, anyway. As far
as that is concerned, all the money will have to come out of the bank
if poor Eva is to be kept where she is. How much money was there that
she had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just fifty-two dollars and seventy cents,&rdquo; replied
Andrew. &ldquo;Jim had left a little that he'd scraped together
somehow, with the letter he wrote to her, and he told her if he had
work he'd send her more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd die before I'd touch it,&rdquo; said Fanny, fiercely.
Then she looked at Andrew with sudden pity. &ldquo;Poor old
man,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it's mighty hard on you when you're
gettin' older, and you never say a word to complain. But I don't see
any other way than to take that money, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you don't think I'm hard to ask it, Andrew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows if it was your sister and my money, I would take
every dollar. You know I would, Andrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; replied Andrew, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe she'll get better before it's quite gone,&rdquo; said
Fanny. &ldquo;You say the doctor gave some hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did, if she was taken proper care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she shall be. I'll go out and steal before she
sha'n't have proper care. Poor Eva!&rdquo;  Fanny burst into the
hysterical wailing which had shaken her from head to foot at
intervals during the last twenty-four hours. Andrew shuddered,
thinking that he detected in her cries a resemblance to her sister's
ravings. &ldquo;Don't, don't, Fanny,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Don't,
poor girl.&rdquo;  He put his arm around her, and she wept on his
shoulder, but with less abandon. &ldquo;After all, we've got each
other, and we've got Ellen, haven't we, Andrew?&rdquo; she
sobbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank God,&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;Don't,
Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that's more than money, more than all the wages
for all the labor in the world, and that we've got, haven't we,
Andrew? We've got what comes to us direct from God, haven't we? Don't
think I'm silly, Andrew&mdash;haven't we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we have&mdash;you are right, Fanny,&rdquo;
replied Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I am, too,&rdquo; she assented, looking up in
Andrew's poor, worn face with eyes of sudden bravery. &ldquo;We'll
get along somehow&mdash;don't you worry, old man. I guess we'll come
out all right, somehow. We'll use that money in the bank as far as it
goes, and then I guess some way will be opened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there came over Andrew's exaltation, to which Fanny's words
had spurred his flagging spirit, a damper of utter mortification and
guilt. He felt that he could bear this no longer. He opened his mouth
to tell her what he had done with the money in the bank, when there
came a knock on the door, and Fanny fled into the bedroom. She had
unfastened her dress, and her face was stained with tears. She shut
the bedroom door tightly as Andrew opened the outer one.</p>

<p>The man who had loaned him the money to buy Ellen's watch stood
there. His name was William Evarts, and he worked in the
stitching-room of McGuire's factory, in which Andrew was employed. He
was reported well-to-do, and to have amassed considerable money from
judicious expenditures of his savings, and to be strictly honest, but
hard in his dealings. He was regarded with a covert disfavor by his
fellow-workmen, as if he were one of themselves who had somehow
elevated himself to a superior height by virtue of their backs. If
William Evarts had acquired prosperity through gambling in mines,
they would have had none of that feeling; they would have recognized
the legitimacy of luck in the conduct of affairs. He was in a way a
reproach to them. &ldquo;Why can't you get along and save as well as
William Evarts?&rdquo; many a man's monitor asked of him. &ldquo;He
doesn't earn any more than you do, and has had as many expenses in
his family.&rdquo;  The man not being able to answer the question to
his own credit, disliked William Evarts who had instigated it.</p>

<p>Andrew, who had in his character a vein of sterling justice, yet
felt that he almost hated William Evarts as he stood there before
him, small and spare, snapping as it were with energy like electric
wires, the strong lines in his clean-shaven face evident in the glare
of the street-lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; Andrew said, and he spoke like a
criminal before a judge, and at that moment he felt like one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; responded the other man. Then he
added, in a hushed voice at first, for he had fineness to appreciate
a sort of indecency in dunning, in asking a man for even his rightful
due, and he had a regard for possible listening ears of femininity,
&ldquo;I was passing by, and I thought I'd call and see if it was
convenient for you to pay me that money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; Andrew responded, with utter subjection.
He looked and felt ignoble. &ldquo;I haven't got it,
Evarts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When are you going to have it?&rdquo; asked the other, in a
slightly raised, ominous voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as I can possibly get it,&rdquo; replied
Andrew, softly and piteously. Ellen's chamber was directly overhead.
He thought of the possibility of her overhearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at here, Andrew Brewster,&rdquo; said the other man,
and this time with brutal, pitiless force. When it came to the
prospect of losing money he became as merciless as a machine.
Something diabolical in remorselessness seemed to come to the
surface, and reveal wheels of grinding for his fellow-men.
&ldquo;Look at here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want to know right out,
and no dodging. Have you got the money to pay me&mdash;yes or
no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Andrew then, with a manliness born of
desperation. He had the feeling of one who will die fighting. He
wished that Evarts would speak lower on account of Ellen, but he was
prepared to face even that. The man's speech came with the gliddering
rush of an electric car; it was a concentration of words into one
intensity of meaning; he elided everything possible, he ran all his
words together. He spoke something in this wise:
&ldquo;GoddamnyouAndrewBrewster, for comin'to borrow money to buy
your girl a watch when you had nothin' to pay for't with,
whatbusinesshadyourgirlwithawatchanyhow,I'dliket'know? My
girl'ain'tgotno watch. I'veputmymoneyinthebank. It'srobbery.
I'llhavethelawonye. I'llsueyou. I'll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment something happened. The man, William Evarts, who
was talking with a vociferousness which seemed cutting and lacerating
to the ear, who was brandishing an arm for emphasis in a circle of
frenzy, fairly jumped to one side. The girl, Ellen Brewster, in a
light wrapper, which she had thrown over her night-gown, came with
such a speed down the stairs which led to the entry directly before
the door, that she seemed to be flying. White ruffles eddied around
her little feet, her golden hair was floating out like a flag. She
came close to William Evarts. &ldquo;Will you please not speak so
loud,&rdquo; said she, in a voice which her father had never heard
from her lips before. It was a voice of pure command, and of command
which carried with it the consciousness of power to enforce. She
stood before William Evarts, and her fine smallness seemed
intensified by her spirit to magnificence. The man shrank back a
little, he had the impression as of some one overtowering him, and
yet the girl came scarcely to his shoulder. &ldquo;Please do not
speak so loud, you will wake Amabel,&rdquo; she said, and Evarts
muttered, like a dog under a whip, that he didn't want to wake her
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;Now here is the
watch and chain. I suppose that will do as well as your money if you
cannot afford to wait for my father to pay you. My father will pay
you in time. He has never borrowed anything of any man which he has
not meant to pay back, and will not pay back. If you cannot afford to
wait, take the watch and chain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man looked at her stupefied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Ellen; &ldquo;take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want your watch an' chain,&rdquo; muttered
Evarts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have either got to take them or wait for your
money,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll wait,&rdquo; said Evarts. He was looking at the girl's
face with mingled sentiments of pity, admiration, and terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;I will promise
you, and my father will, that you shall have your money in time, but
how long do you want to wait?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll wait any time. I ain't in any straits for the money,
if I get it in the end,&rdquo; said Evarts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will get it in the end,&rdquo; said Ellen. Evarts
turned to Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, give me your note for six months,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and we'll call it all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Andrew, again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are not satisfied with that,&rdquo; said Ellen, with
a tone as if she were conferring inestimable benefits, so proud it
was, &ldquo;you can take the watch and chain. It is not hurt in the
least. Here.&rdquo;  She was fairly insolent. Evarts regarded her
with a mixture of admiration and terror. He told somebody the next
day that Andrew Brewster had a stepper of a daughter, but he did not
give his reasons for the statement. He had a sense of honor, and he
had been in love with a girl as young before he married his wife, who
had been a widow older than he, worth ten thousand dollars from her
first husband. He could no more have taken the girl's watch and chain
than he would have killed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm quite satisfied,&rdquo; he replied to her, making a
repellant motion towards the watch and dangling chain glittering in
the electric-light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Ellen, and she threw the chain
over her neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just bring that I O U to the shop to-mor-mor,&rdquo;
said Evarts to Andrew; then, with a &ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; he
was off. They heard him hail an electric-car passing, and that,
although he never took a car, but walked to save the fare. He had
been often heard to say that he for one did not support the street
railroad.</p>

<p>After he had gone, Ellen turned to her father, and flung a silent
white arm slipping from her sleeve loose around his neck, and pulled
his head to her shoulder. &ldquo;Now look here, father,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;you've been through lots to-day, and you'd better go to
bed and go to sleep. I don't think mother was waked up&mdash;if she
had been, she would have been out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ellen, I want to tell you,&rdquo; Andrew began,
pitifully. He was catching his breath like a child with sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want to hear anything,&rdquo; replied Ellen,
firmly. &ldquo;Whatever you did was right, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to tell you, Ellen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to tell me nothing,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;You
are all tired out, father. You can't do anything that isn't right for
me. Now go to bed and go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen stroked her father's thin gray hair with exactly the same
tender touch with which he had so often stroked her golden locks. It
was an inheritance of love reverting to its original source. She
kissed him on his lined forehead with her flower-like lips, then she
pushed him gently away. &ldquo;Go softly, and don't wake
mother,&rdquo; whispered she; &ldquo;and, father, there's no need to
trouble her with this. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXIV</h3>

<p>Ellen's deepest emotion was pity for her father, so intense that
it was actual physical pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor father! Poor father! He had to borrow the money to buy
me my watch and chain,&rdquo; she kept repeating to herself.
&ldquo;Poor father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To her New England mind, borrowing seemed almost like robbing. She
actually felt as if her father had committed a crime for love of her,
but all she looked at was the love, not the guilt. Suddenly a
conviction which fairly benumbed her came over her&mdash;the money in
the savings-bank; that little hoard, which had been to the
imagination of herself and her mother a sheet-anchor against poverty,
must be gone. &ldquo;Father must have used if for something unbeknown
to mother,&rdquo; she said to herself&mdash;&ldquo;he must, else he
would not have told Mr. Evarts that he could not pay him.&rdquo;  It
was a hot night, but the girl shivered as she realized for the first
time the meaning of the wolf at the door. &ldquo;All we've got left
is this house&mdash;this house and&mdash;and&mdash;our hands,&rdquo;
thought Ellen. She saw before her her father's poor, worn hands, her
mother's thin, tired hands, jerking the thread in and out of those
shameful wrappers; then she looked at her own, as yet untouched by
toil, as white and small and fair as flowers. She thought of the four
years before her at college, four years before she could earn
anything&mdash;and in the mean time? She looked at the pile of her
school-books on the table. She had been studying hard all summer. The
thirst for knowledge was as intense in her as the thirst for
stimulants in a drunkard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to give up going to college, and go to work in the
shop,&rdquo; Ellen said to herself, and she said it as one might
drive a probing-knife into a sore. &ldquo;I ought to,&rdquo; she
repeated. And yet she was far from resolving to give up college. She
began to argue with herself the expediancy, supposing that the money
in the bank was gone, of putting a mortgage on the house. If her
father continued to have work, they might get along and pay for her
aunt, who might, as the doctor had said, not be obliged to remain
long in the asylum if properly cared for. Would it not, after all, be
better, since by a course at college she would be fitted to command a
larger salary than she could in any other way. &ldquo;I can support
them all,&rdquo; reflected Ellen. At that time the thought of Robert
Lloyd, and that awakening of heart which he had brought to pass, were
in abeyance. Old powers had asserted themselves. This love for her
own blood and their need came between her and this new love, half of
the senses, half of the spirit.</p>

<p>Amabel waked up in the early sultry dawn of the summer day with
the bewilderment of one in a new world. She stared at the walls of
the room, at the shaft of sunlight streaming in the window, then at
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; she inquired, in a loud, querulous
plaint. Then she remembered, but she did not cry; instead, her little
face took on a painfully old look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are here with cousin Ellen, darling, don't you
know?&rdquo; Ellen replied, leaning over her, and kissing her.</p>

<p>Amabel wriggled impatiently away, and faced to the wall.
&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>That morning Amabel would not eat any breakfast, and Fanny
suggested that Ellen take her for a ride on the street-cars.
&ldquo;We can get along without you for an hour,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;and I am afraid that child will be sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Ellen and Amabel set out, leaving Fanny and the dressmaker at
work, and when they were returning past the factories the noon
whistles were blowing and the operatives were streaming forth.</p>

<p>Ellen was surprised to see her father among them as the car swept
past. He walked down the street towards home, his dinner-bag dangling
at his side, his back more bent than ever.</p>

<p>She wondered uneasily if her father was ill, for he never went
home to dinner. She looked back at him as the car swept past, but he
did not seem to see her. He walked with an air of seeing nothing,
covering the ground like an old dog with some patient, dumb end in
view, heeding nothing by the way. It puzzled her also that her father
had come out of Lloyd's instead of McGuire's, where he had been
employed all summer. Ellen, after she reached home, watched anxiously
for her father to come into the yard, but she did not see him. She
assisted about the dinner, which was a little extra on account of the
dressmaker, and all the time she glanced with covert anxiety at the
window, but her father did not pass it. Finally, when she went out to
the pump for a pitcher of water, she set the pitcher down, and sped
to the orchard like a wild thing. A suspicion had seized her that her
father was there.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there he was, but instead of lying face down on the
grass, as he had done before, he was sitting back against a tree. He
had the air of having settled into such a long lease of despair that
he had sought the most comfortable position for it. His face was
ghastly. He looked at Ellen as she drew near, and opened his mouth as
if to speak, but instead he only caught his breath. He stared hard at
her, then he closed his eyes as if not to see her, and motioned her
away with one hand with an inarticulate noise in his throat.</p>

<p>But Ellen sat down beside him. She caught his two hands and looked
at him. &ldquo;Father, look at me,&rdquo; said she, and Andrew opened
his eyes. The expression in them was dreadful, compounded of shame
and despair and dread, but the girl's met them with a sort of glad
triumph and strength of love. &ldquo;Now look here, father,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;you tell me all about it. I didn't want to know last
night. Now I want to know. What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew continued to look at her, then all at once he spoke with a
kind of hoarse shout. &ldquo;I'm discharged! I'm discharged,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;from McGuire's; they've got a boy who can move faster
in my place&mdash;a boy for less pay, who can move faster. I hurried
over to Lloyd's to see if they would take me on again; I've always
thought I should get back into Lloyd's, and I saw the foreman, and he
told me to my face that I was too old, that they wanted younger men.
And I went into the office to see Lloyd, pushed past the foreman,
with him damning me, and I saw Lloyd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was young Mr. Lloyd there?&rdquo; asked Ellen, with white
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I guess he had gone to dinner. And Lloyd looked at me,
and I believe he counted every gray hair in my head, and he saw my
back, and he saw my hands, and he said&mdash;he said I was too
old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew snatched his hands from Ellen's grasp, pressed them to his
face, and broke into weeping. &ldquo;Oh, my God, I'm too old, I'm too
old!&rdquo; he sobbed; &ldquo;I'm out of it! I'm too old!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen regarded him, and her face had developed lines of strength
hitherto unrevealed. There was no pity in it, hardly love; she looked
angry and powerful. &ldquo;Father, stop doing so, and look at
me,&rdquo; she said. She dragged her father's hands from his face,
and he stared at her with his inflamed eyes, half terrified, half
sustained. At that moment he realized a strength of support as from
his own lost youth, a strength as of eternal progress which was more
to be relied upon than other human strength. For the first time he
leaned on his child, and realized with wonder the surety of the
stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, father, you stop doing so,&rdquo; said Ellen.
&ldquo;You can get work somewhere; you are not old. Call yourself
old! It is nonsense. Are you going to give in and be old because two
men tell you that you are? What if your hair is gray! Ever so many
young men have gray hair. You are not old, and you can get work
somewhere. McGuire's and Lloyd's are not the only factories in the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain't all,&rdquo; said Andrew, with eyes like a
beseeching dog's on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that isn't all,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;You
needn't be afraid to tell me, father. You have taken the money out of
the savings-bank for something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Andrew would have snatched his hands from the girl's and
hidden his face, but she held them fast. &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo;
he admitted, in a croaking voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what if you have?&rdquo; asked Ellen. &ldquo;You had
a right to take it out, didn't you? You put it in. I don't know of
anybody who had a better right to take it out than you, if you wanted
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew stared at her, as if he did not hear rightly. &ldquo;You
don't know what I did with it, Ellen,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nobody's business,&rdquo; replied Ellen. She had an
unexplained sensation as if she were holding fast to her father's
slipping self-respect which was dragging hard at her restraining
love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put it in a worthless gold-mine out in Colorado&mdash;the
same one your uncle Jim lost his money in,&rdquo; groaned Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was your money, and you had a perfect right
to,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;Of course you thought the mine was all
right or you wouldn't have put the money into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the best business men in the world make mistakes. It
is nobody's business whether you took the money out or not, or what
you used it for, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see how the bills are going to be paid, and there's
your poor aunt,&rdquo; said Andrew. He was leaning more and more
heavily upon this new tower of strength, this tender little girl whom
he had hitherto shielded and supported. The beautiful law of reverse
of nature had come into force.</p>

<p>Ellen set her mouth firmly. &ldquo;Don't you worry, father,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;We will think of some way out of it. There's a
little money to pay for Aunt Eva, and maybe she won't be sick long.
Does mother know, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She don't know about anything, Ellen,&rdquo; replied
Andrew, wretchedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know she doesn't know about your getting thrown out of
work&mdash;but about the bank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen rose. &ldquo;You stay here, where it is cool, till I ring
the dinner-bell, father,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want any dinner, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do, father. If you don't eat your dinner you will
be sick. You come when the bell rings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew knew that he should obey, as he saw the girl's light dress
disappear among the trees.</p>

<p>Ellen went back to the pump, and carried her pitcher of water into
the house. Her mother met her at the door. &ldquo;Where have you been
all this time, Ellen Brewster?&rdquo; she asked, in a high voice.
&ldquo;Everything is getting as cold as a stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen caught her mother's arm and drew her into the kitchen, and
closed the door. Fanny turned pale as death and looked at her.
&ldquo;Well, what has happened now?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is your
father killed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;but he is out of work, and he
can't get a job at Lloyd's, and he took all that money out of the
savings-bank a long time ago, and put it into that gold-mine that
Uncle Jim lost in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny clutched the girl's arm in a grasp so hard that it left a
blue mark on the tender flesh. She looked at her, but did not speak
one word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, mother,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;you must not say one
word to father to scold him. He's got enough to bear as it
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny pushed her away with sudden fierceness. &ldquo;I guess I
don't need to have my own daughter teach me my duty to my
husband,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down in the orchard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ring the bell for dinner loud, so he can hear
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Andrew came shuffling wearily up from the orchard, Fanny met
him at the corner of the house, out of sight from the windows. She
was flushed and perspiring, clad in a coarse cotton wrapper,
revealing all her unkempt curves. She went close to him, and thrust
one large arm through his. &ldquo;Look here, Andrew,&rdquo; said she,
in the tenderest voice he had ever heard from her, a voice so tender
that it was furious, &ldquo;you needn't say one word. What's done's
done. We shall get along somehow. I ain't afraid. Come in and eat
your dinner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dressmaking work went on as usual after dinner. Andrew had
disappeared, going down the road towards the shop. He tried for a job
at Briggs's, with no success, then drifted to the corner grocery.</p>

<p>Ellen sat until nearly three o'clock sewing. Then she went
up-stairs and got her hat, and went secretly out of the back door,
through the west yard, that her mother should not see her. However,
her grandmother called after her, and wanted to know where she was
going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down street, on an errand,&rdquo; answered Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, keep on the shady side,&rdquo; called her
grandmother, thinking the girl was bound to the stores for some
dressmaking supplies.</p>

<p>That night Miss Higgins did not ask for her pay; she had made up
her mind to wait until her week was finished. She went away after
supper, and Ellen followed her to the door. &ldquo;We won't want you
to-morrow, Miss Higgins,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and here is your
pay.&rdquo;  With that she handed a roll of bills to the woman, who
stared at her in amazement and growing resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my work ain't satisfactory,&rdquo; said she&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your work is satisfactory,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;but I
don't want any more work done. I am not going to college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something conclusive and intimidating about Ellen's look
and tone. The dressmaker, who had been accustomed to regard her as a
child, stared at her with awe, as before a sudden revelation of
force. Then she took her money, and went down the walk.</p>

<p>When Ellen re-entered the sitting-room her father and mother, who
had overheard every word, confronted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen Brewster, what does this mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew looked as if he would presently fall to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said Ellen&mdash;and she looked at her
parents with the brave enthusiasm of a soldier on her beautiful
face&mdash;she even laughed&mdash;&ldquo;it means that I am going to
work&mdash;I have got a job in Lloyd's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Ellen made that announcement, her mother did a strange thing.
She ran swiftly to a corner of the room, and stood there, staring at
the girl, with back hugged close to the intersection of the walls, as
if she would withdraw as far as possible from some threatening ill.
At that moment she looked alarmingly like her sister; there was
something about Fanny in her corner, calculated, when all
circumstances were taken into consideration, to make one's blood
chill, but Andrew did not look at her. He was intent upon Ellen, and
the facing of the worst agony of his life, and Ellen was intent upon
him. She loved her mother, but the fear as to her father's suffering
moved her more than her mother's. She was more like her father, and
could better estimate his pain under stress. Andrew rose to his feet
and stood looking at Ellen, and she at him. She tried to meet the
drawn misery and incredulousness of his face with a laugh of
reassurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I've got a job in Lloyd's,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;What's the matter, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Andrew made an almost inarticulate response; it sounded like
a croak in an unknown tongue.</p>

<p>Ellen continued to look at him, and to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here, father,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;There is no
need for you and mother to feel bad over this. I have thought it all
over, and I have made up my mind. I have got a good high-school
education now, and the four years I should have to spend at Vassar I
could do nothing at all. There is awful need of money here, and not
only for us, but for Aunt Eva and Amabel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sha'n't do it!&rdquo; Andrew burst out then, in a great
shout of rage. &ldquo;I'll mortgage the house&mdash;that'll last
awhile. You sha'n't, I say! You are my child, and you've got to
listen. You sha'n't, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, father,&rdquo; responded Ellen's voice, which seemed
to have in it a wonderful tone of firmness against which his agonized
vociferousness broke as against a rock, &ldquo;this is nonsense. You
must not mortgage the house. The house is all you have got for your
and mother's old age. Do you think I could go to college, and let you
give up the house in order to keep me there? And as for grandma
Brewster, you know what's hers is hers as long as she lives&mdash;we
don't want to think of that. I have got this job now, which is only
three dollars a week, but in a year the foreman said I might earn
fifteen or eighteen, if I was quick and smart, and I will be quick
and smart. It is the best thing for us all, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sha'n't!&rdquo; shouted Andrew. &ldquo;I say you
sha'n't!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Andrew sank into a chair, his head lopped, he kept moving
a hand before his eyes, as if he were brushing away cobwebs. Then
Fanny came out of her corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get the camphor, quick!&rdquo; she said to Ellen. &ldquo;I
dun'no' but you've killed your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny held her husband's head against her shoulder, and rubbed his
hands frantically. The awful strained look had gone from her face.
Ellen came with the camphor, and then went for water. Fanny rubbed
Andrew's forehead with the camphor, and held the bottle to his nose.
&ldquo;Smell it, Andrew,&rdquo; she said, in a voice of ineffable
tenderness and pity. Ellen returned with a glass of water, and Andrew
swallowed a little obediently. Finally he made out to stagger into
the bedroom with Fanny's and Ellen's assistance. He sat down weakly
on the bed, and Fanny lifted his legs up. Then he sank and closed his
eyes as if he were spent. In fact, he was. At that moment of Ellen's
announcement some vital energy in him suddenly relaxed like
overstrained rubber. His face, sunken in the pillow, was both ghastly
and meek. It was the face of a man who could fight no more. Ellen
knelt down beside him, sobbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;I think it is for the
best. Dear father, you won't feel bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Andrew, faintly. There was a slight
twitching in his hand, as if he wished to put it on her head, then it
lay thin and inert on the coverlid. He tried to smile, but his face
settled into that look of utter acquiescence of fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s'pose it's the best you can do,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you told Miss Lennox?&rdquo; gasped Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was sorry, but she made no objection,&rdquo; replied
Ellen, evasively.</p>

<p>Fanny came forward abruptly, caught up the camphor-bottle, and
began bathing Andrew's forehead again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won't say any more about it,&rdquo; said she, in a harsh
voice. &ldquo;You'd better go over to your grandma Brewster's and see
if she has got any whiskey. I think your father needs to take
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want anything,&rdquo; said Andrew, feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do, too, you are as white as a sheet. Go over and
ask her, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen ran across the yard to her grandmother's, and the old woman
met her at the door. She seemed to have an instinctive knowledge of
trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father's a little faint, and mother wants me to borrow the
whiskey,&rdquo; said Ellen. She had not at that time the courage to
tell her grandmother what she had done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes ran into the house, and came out with the bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm comin' over,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I'm kind of
worried about your father; he 'ain't looked well for some time. I
wonder what made him faint. Maybe he ate something which hurt
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen said nothing. She fled up-stairs to her chamber, as her
grandmother entered the bedroom. She felt cowardly, but she thought
that she would let her mother tell the news.</p>

<p>She sat down and waited. She knew that presently she would hear
the old woman's voice at the foot of the stairs. She was resolved
upon her course, and knew that she could not be shaken in it, yet she
dreaded unspeakably the outburst of grief and anger which she knew
would come from her grandmother. She felt as if she had faced two
fires, and now before the third she quailed a little.</p>

<p>It was not long before the expected summons came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen&mdash;Ellen Brewster, come down here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen went down. Her grandmother met her at the foot of the
stairs. She was trembling from head to foot; her mouth twisted and
wavered as if she had the palsy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ellen Brewster, this ain't true?&rdquo; she
stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, grandma,&rdquo; answered Ellen. &ldquo;I have thought
it all over, and it is the only thing for me to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her grandmother clutched her arm, and the girl felt as if she were
in the grasp of another will, which was more conclusive than
steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sha'n't!&rdquo; she said, whispering, lest Andrew
should hear, but with intense force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got to, grandma. We've got to have the
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The money,&rdquo; said the old woman, with an inflection of
voice and a twist of her features indicative of the most superb
scorn&mdash;&ldquo;the money! I guess you ain't goin' to lose such a
chance as that for money. I guess I've got two hundred and ten
dollars a year income, and I'll give up a half of that, and Andrew
can put a mortgage on the house, if that Tenny woman has got to be
supported because her husband has run off and left her and her young
one. You sha'n't go to work in a shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got to, grandma,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>The old woman looked at her. It was like a duel between two strong
wills of an old race. &ldquo;You sha'n't,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall, grandma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the old woman turned upon her in a fury of rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're a Loud all over, Ellen Brewster,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;You 'ain't got a mite of Brewster about you. You 'ain't got
any pride! You'd just as soon settle down and work in a shop as do
anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny pushed before her. &ldquo;Look here, Mother Brewster,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;you can just stop! Ellen is my daughter, and you
'ain't any right to talk to her this way. I won't have it. If anybody
is goin' to blame her, it's me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who be you?&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes, sniffing.</p>

<p>Then she looked at them both, at Ellen and at her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you go an' do what you've planned,&rdquo; said she to
Ellen, &ldquo;an' if you uphold her in it,&rdquo; to Fanny,
&ldquo;I've done with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; said Fanny, coarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't goin' to forget that you said that,&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Zelotes. She held up her dress high in front and went out of the
door. &ldquo;I ain't comin' over here again, an' I'll thank you to
stay at home,&rdquo; said she. Then she went away.</p>

<p>Soon after Fanny heard Ellen in the dining-room setting the table
for supper, and went out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that money you paid the dressmaker
with?&rdquo; she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I borrowed it of Abby,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny continued to look at Ellen with the look of one who is
settling down with resignation under some knife of agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there's no need to talk any
more about it before your father. Now I guess you had better toast
him some bread for his supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; replied Ellen. She looked at her mother
pitifully, and yet with that firmness which had seemed to suddenly
develop in her. &ldquo;You know it is the best thing for me to do,
mother?&rdquo; she said, and although she put it in the form of a
question, the statement was commanding in its assertiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When are you&mdash;goin' to work?&rdquo; asked Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next Monday,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXV</h3>

<p>When Ellen had gone to the factory to apply for work neither of
the Lloyds were in the office, only a girl at the desk, whom she knew
slightly. Ellen had hesitated a little as she approached the girl,
who looked around with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see&mdash;&rdquo; Ellen began, then she stopped,
for she did not exactly know for whom she should ask. The girl, who
was blond and trim, clad coquettishly in a blue shirt-waist and a
duck skirt, with a large, cheap rhinestone pin confining the loop of
her yellow braids, looked at her in some bewilderment. She had heard
of Ellen's good-fortune, and knew she was to be sent to Vassar by
Cynthia Lennox. She did not dream that she had come to ask for
employment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to see Mr. Lloyd?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robert Lloyd?&rdquo;  The girl, whose name was Nellie
Stone, laughed a little meaningly as she said that.</p>

<p>Ellen blushed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I want
to see the foreman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which foreman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Ellen. &ldquo;I want to get
work if I can. I don't know which foreman I ought to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get work?&rdquo; repeated the girl, with a subtle change
in her manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen. She could hear her heart beat, but
she looked at the other girl's pretty, common face with the most
perfect calmness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Flynn is the one you want to see, then,&rdquo; said the
girl. &ldquo;You know Ed Flynn, don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; replied Ellen. He had been a big boy when
she entered the high-school, and had left the next spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he's the one you want,&rdquo; said Nellie Stone. Then
she raised her voice to a shrill peal as a boy passed the office
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you, Jack,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;ask Mr. Flynn to
come here a minute, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don't want to see you,&rdquo; replied the boy, who was
small and spare, laden heavily with a great roll of wrapping paper
borne bayonet fashion over his shoulder. His round, impish face
grinned back at the girl at the desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit your impudence,&rdquo; she returned, half laughing
herself. &ldquo;I don't want to see him; it is this young lady here;
hurry up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy gave a comprehensive glance at Ellen. &ldquo;Guess he'll
come,&rdquo; he called back.</p>

<p>Flynn appeared soon. He was handsome, well shaven and shorn, and
he held himself smartly. He also dressed well in a business suit
which would not have disgraced the Lloyds. His face lit up with
astonishment and pleasure when he saw Ellen. He bowed and greeted her
in a rich voice. He was of Irish descent but American born. Both his
motions and his speech were adorned with flourishes of grace which
betrayed his race. He placed a chair for Ellen with a sweep which
would have been a credit to the stage. All his actions had a slight
exaggeration as of fresco painting, which seemed to fit them for a
stage rather than a room, and for an audience rather than chance
spectators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Ellen. Then she went straight
to the matter in hand. &ldquo;I have called to see if I could get a
job here?&rdquo; she said. She had been formulating her speech all
the way thither. Her first impulse was to ask for employment, but she
was sure as to the manner in which a girl would ordinarily couch such
a request. So she asked for a job.</p>

<p>Flynn stared at her. &ldquo;A job?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want very much to get one,&rdquo; replied Ellen.
&ldquo;I thought there might be a vacancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought&mdash;&rdquo; said the young man. He was
very much astonished, but his natural polish could rise above
astonishment. Instead of blurting out what was in his mind as to her
change of prospects, he reasoned with incredible swiftness that the
change must be a hard thing to this girl, and that she was to be
handled the more tenderly and delicately because she was such a
pretty girl. He became twice as polite as before. He moved the chair
nearer to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; he said. He handed to her the
wooden arm-chair as if it had been a throne. Nellie Stone bent
frowning over her day-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let me see,&rdquo; said the young man, seriously, with
perfect deference of manner, only belied by the rollicking admiration
in his eyes. &ldquo;You have never held a position in a factory
before, I think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is at present only one vacancy that I can think
of,&rdquo; said Flynn, &ldquo;and that does not pay very much, but
there is always a chance to rise for a smart hand. I am sure you will
be that,&rdquo; he added, smiling at her.</p>

<p>Ellen did not return the smile. &ldquo;I shall be contented to
begin for a little, if there is a chance to rise,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a chance to rise to eighteen dollars a week,&rdquo;
said Flynn. He smiled again, but it was like smiling at seriousness
itself. Ellen's downright, searching eyes upon his face seemed almost
to forbid the fact of her own girlish identity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the job you have for me?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tying strings in shoes,&rdquo; answered Flynn. &ldquo;Easy
enough, only child's play, but you won't earn more than three dollars
a week to begin with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be quite satisfied with that,&rdquo; said Ellen.
&ldquo;When shall I come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to-morrow morning; no, to-morrow is Friday. Better
come next Monday and begin the week. That will give you one day more
off, and the hot wave a chance to get past.&rdquo;  Flynn spoke
facetiously. It was a very hot day, and the air in the office like a
furnace. He wiped his forehead, to which the dark rings of hair
clung. The girl at the desk glanced around adoringly at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather not stop for that if you want me to begin at
once,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Flynn looked abashed. &ldquo;Oh, we'd rather have you begin on the
even week&mdash;it makes less bother over the account,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Monday morning at seven sharp, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Flynn walked off with an abrupt duck of his head. He somehow felt
that he had been rebuffed, and Ellen rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you you'd get one,&rdquo; said the girl at the desk.
&ldquo;Catch Ed Flynn not giving a pretty girl a job.&rdquo;  She
said it with an accent of pain as well as malice. Ellen looked at her
with large, indignant eyes. She had not the least idea what she
meant, at least she realized only the surface meaning, and that
angered her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he gave me the job because there was a
vacancy,&rdquo; she returned, with dignity.</p>

<p>The other girl laughed. &ldquo;Mebbe,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Ellen continued to look at her, and there was something in her
look not only indignant, but appealing. Nellie Stone's expression
changed again. She laughed uneasily. &ldquo;Land, I didn't mean
anything,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I'm glad for you that you got the
job. Of course you wouldn't have got it if there hadn't been a
chance. One of the girls got married last week, Maud Millet. I guess
it's her place you've got. I'm real glad you've got it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>On Monday morning the heat had broken, and an east wind with the
breath of the sea in it was blowing. Ellen started for her work at
half-past six. She held her father's little, worn leather-bag, in
which he had carried his dinner for so many years. The walk was so
long that it would scarcely give her time to come home at noon, and
as for taking a car, that was not to be thought of for a moment on
account of the fare.</p>

<p>Ellen walked along briskly, the east wind blew in her face, she
smelled the salt sea, and somehow it at once soothed and stimulated
her. Without seeing the mighty waste of waters, she seemed to realize
its presence; she gazed at the sky hanging low with a scud of gray
clouds, which did not look unlike the ocean, and the sense of
irresponsibility in the midst of infinity comforted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not Ellen Brewster after all,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;I am not anything separate enough to be worried about what
comes to me. I am only a part of greatness which cannot fail of
reaching its end.&rdquo;  She thought this all vaguely. She had no
language for it, for she was very young; it was formless as music,
but as true to her.</p>

<p>When she reached the cross-street where the Atkinses lived Abby
and Maria came running out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My land, Ellen Brewster,&rdquo; said Abby, half angrily,
&ldquo;if you don't look real happy! I believe you are glad to go to
work in a shoe-shop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen laughed. Maria said nothing, but she pressed close to her as
she walked along. She was coughing a little in the east wind. There
had been a drop of twenty degrees in the night, and these drops of
temperature in New England mean steps to the tomb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make me mad,&rdquo; said Abby. Her voice broke a
little. She dashed her hand across her eyes angrily. &ldquo;Here's
Granville Joy,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you'll be in the same room
with him, Ellen.&rdquo;  She said it maliciously. Distress over her
friend made her fairly malicious.</p>

<p>Ellen colored. &ldquo;You are hard to talk to,&rdquo; said she, in
a low voice, for Granville was coming nearer, gaining on them from
behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She don't mean it,&rdquo; whispered Maria.</p>

<p>When Granville caught up with them, Ellen pressed so close to
Maria that he was forced to walk with Abby or pass on. She returned
his &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; then did not look at him again.
Presently Willy Jones appeared, coming so imperceptibly that he
seemed almost impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did he come from?&rdquo; whispered Ellen to
Maria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; replied Maria; &ldquo;it's this way 'most
every morning. All at once he comes, and he generally walks with me,
because he's afraid Abby won't want him, but it's Abby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This morning, Willy Jones, aroused, perhaps, to self-assertion by
the presence of another man, walked three abreast with Abby and
Granville, but on the other side of Granville. Now and then he peered
around the other man at the girl, with soft, wistful blue eyes, but
Abby never seemed to see him. She talked fast, in a harsh, rather
loud voice. She uttered bitter witticisms which made her companions
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abby is so bright,&rdquo; whispered Maria to Ellen,
&ldquo;but I wish she wouldn't talk so. Abby doesn't feel the way I
wish she did. She rebels. She would be happier if she gave up
rebelling and believed.&rdquo;  Maria coughed as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better keep your mouth shut in this east wind,
Maria,&rdquo; her sister called out sharply to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not talking much, Abby,&rdquo; replied Maria.</p>

<p>Presently Maria looked at Ellen lovingly. &ldquo;Do you feel very
badly about going to work?&rdquo; she asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not now. I have made up my mind,&rdquo; replied Ellen.
The east wind was bringing a splendid color to her cheeks. She held
up her head as she marched along, like one leading a charge of
battle. Her eyes gleamed as with blue fire, her yellow hair sprung
and curled around her temples.</p>

<p>They were now in the midst of a great, hurrying procession bound
for the factories. Some of the men walked silently, with a dogged
stoop of shoulders and shambling hitch of hips; some of the women
moved droopingly, with an indescribable effect of hanging back from
the leading of some imperious hand of fate. Many of them, both men
and women, walked alertly and chattered like a flock of sparrows.
Ellen moved with this rank and file of the army of labor, and all at
once a sense of comradeship seized her. She began to feel humanity as
she had never felt it before. The sense of her own littleness aroused
her to a power of comprehension of the grandeur of the mass of which
she was a part. She began to lose herself and sense humanity.</p>

<p>When the people reached the factories, two on one side of the
road, one, Lloyd's, on the other, they began streaming up the outside
stairs and disappearing like swarms of bees in hives. Two flights of
stairs, one on each side, led to a platform in front of the entrance
of Lloyd's.</p>

<p>When Ellen set her foot on one of these stairs the seven-o'clock
steam-whistle blew, and a mighty thrill shot through the vast
building. Ellen caught her breath. Abby came close to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't get scared,&rdquo; said she, with ungracious
tenderness; &ldquo;there's nothing to be scared at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen laughed. &ldquo;I'm not scared,&rdquo; said she. Then they
entered the factory, humming with machinery, and a sensation which
she had not anticipated was over her. Scared she was not; she was
fairly exultant. All at once she entered a vast room in which eager
men were already at the machines with frantic zeal, as if they were
driving labor herself. When she felt the vibration of the floor under
her feet, when she saw people spring to their stations of toil, as if
springing to guns in a battle, she realized the might and grandeur of
it all. Suddenly it seemed to her that the greatest thing in the
whole world was work and that this was one of the greatest forms of
work&mdash;to cover the feet of progress of the travellers of the
earth from the cradle to the grave. She saw that these great
factories, and the strength of this army of the sons and daughters of
toil, made possible the advance of civilization itself, which cannot
go barefoot. She realized all at once and forever the dignity of
labor, this girl of the people, with a brain which enabled her to
overlook the heads of the rank and file of which she herself formed a
part. She never again, whatever her regret might have been for
another life for which she was better fitted, which her taste
preferred, had any sense of ignominy in this. She never again felt
that she was too good for her labor, for labor had revealed itself to
her like a goddess behind a sordid veil. Abby and Maria looked at her
wonderingly. No other girl had ever entered Lloyd's with such a look
on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sick?&rdquo; whispered Abby, catching her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;No, don't worry me, Abby. I
think I shall like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare you make me mad,&rdquo; said Abby, but she looked
at her adoringly. &ldquo;Here's Ed Flynn,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;He'll look out for you. Good-bye, I'll see you at noon.&rdquo;
 Abby went away to her machine. She was stitching vamps by the piece,
and earning a considerable amount. The Atkinses were not so
distressed as they had been, and Abby was paying off a mortgage.</p>

<p>When the foreman came towards Ellen she experienced a shock. His
gay, admiring eyes on her face seemed to dispel all her exaltation.
She felt as if her feet touched earth, and yet the young man was
entirely respectful, and even thoughtful. He bade her
&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; and conducted her to the scene of her
labor. One other girl was already there at work. She gave a sidewise
glance at Ellen, and went on, making her fingers fly. Mr. Flynn
showed Ellen what to do. She had to tie the shoes together with bits
of twine, laced through eyelet holes. Ellen took a piece of twine and
tied it in as Flynn watched her. He laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll do,&rdquo; he said, approvingly. &ldquo;I've been in
here five years, and you are the first girl I ever saw who tied a
square knot at the first trial. Here's Mamie Brady here, she worked a
solid month before she got the hang of the square knot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go along,&rdquo; admonished the girl spoken of as
&ldquo;Mamie Brady.&rdquo;  Her words were flippant, even impudent,
but her tone was both dejected and childish. She continued to work
without a glance at either of them. Her fingers flew, tying the knots
with swift jerks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you help Miss Brewster, if she needs any help,&rdquo;
said Flynn, as he went away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don't have any misses in this shop,&rdquo; said the girl
to Ellen, with sarcastic emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care anything about being called miss,&rdquo;
replied Ellen, picking up another piece of string.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's your first name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, land! I know who you be. You read that essay at the
high-school graduation. I was there. Well, I shouldn't think you
would want to be called miss if you feel the way you said you did in
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want to,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>The girl gave a swift, comprehensive glance at her as her fingers
manipulated the knots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won't earn twenty cents a week at the rate you're
workin',&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;look at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe you worked any faster than I do when you
hadn't been here any longer,&rdquo; retorted Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, too; you can't depend on a thing Ed Flynn says.
You're awful slow. He praises you because you are
good-lookin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen turned and faced her. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>The other girl looked at her with unspeakable impudence, and yet
under it was that shadow of dejection and that irresponsible
childishness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am lookin',&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what is
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not speak to me again in that way,&rdquo; said
Ellen, &ldquo;and I want you to understand it. I will not have
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, ain't you awful smart,&rdquo; said the other girl,
sneeringly, but she went on with her work without another word.
Presently she said to Ellen, kindly enough: &ldquo;If you lay the
shoes the way I do, so, you can get them faster. You'll find it pays.
Every little saving of time counts when you are workin' by the
piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ellen, and did as she was
instructed. She began to work with exceeding swiftness for a
beginner. Her fingers were supple, her nervous energy great. Flynn
came and stood beside her, watching her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you work at that rate, you'll make it pretty
profitable,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a square knot every time,&rdquo; he added, with almost
a caressing inflection. Mamie Brady tied in the twine with compressed
lips. Granville Joy passed them, pushing a rack full of shoes to
another department, and he glanced at them jealously. Still he was
not seriously alarmed as to Flynn, who, although he was good-looking,
was a Catholic. Mrs. Zelotes seemed an effectual barrier to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ed Flynn talks that way to everybody,&rdquo; Mamie Brady
said to Ellen, after the foreman had passed on. She said it this time
quite inoffensively. Ellen laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I <em>do</em> tie the knots square, that is the main
thing,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you don't like him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never spoke two words to him before the day I applied for
work,&rdquo; Ellen replied, haughtily. She was beginning to feel that
perhaps the worst feature of her going to work in a factory would be
this girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've known girls who would be willing to go down on their
knees and tie his shoes when they hadn't seen more of him than
that,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Ed Flynn is an awful
masher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen went on with her work. The girl, after a side glance at her,
went on with hers.</p>

<p>Gradually Ellen's work began to seem mechanical. At first she had
felt as if she were tying all her problems of life in square knots.
She had to use all her brain upon it; after a while her brain had so
informed her fingers that they had learned their lesson well enough
to leave her free to think, if only the girl at her side would let
her alone. The girl had a certain harsh beauty, coarsely curling red
hair, a great mass of it, gathered in an untidy knot, and a brilliant
complexion. Her hands were large and red. Ellen's contrasted with
them looked like a baby's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You 'ain't got hands for workin' in a shoe-shop,&rdquo;
said Mamie Brady, presently, and it was impossible to tell from her
tone whether she envied or admired Ellen's hands, or was proud of the
superior strength of her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they've got to work in a shoe-shop,&rdquo; said
Ellen, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won't find it so easy to work with such little mites of
hands when it comes to some things,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>It began to be clear that she exulted in her large, coarse hands
as being fitted for her work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe mine will grow larger,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they won't. They'll grow all bony and knotty, but they
won't grow any bigger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall have to get along with them the best way I
can,&rdquo; replied Ellen, rather impatiently. This girl was
irritating to a degree, and yet there was all the time that vague
dejection about her, and withal a certain childishness, which seemed
to insist upon patience. The girl was really older than Ellen, but
she was curiously unformed. Some of the other girls said openly that
she was &ldquo;lacking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You act stuck up. Are you stuck up?&rdquo; asked Mamie
Brady, suddenly, after another pause.</p>

<p>Ellen laughed in spite of herself. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;I am not. I know of no reason that I have for being stuck
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know of any either,&rdquo; said the other
girl, &ldquo;but I didn't know. You sort of acted as if you felt
stuck up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk stuck up. Why don't you talk the way the rest of
us do? Why do you say &lsquo;am not,&rsquo; and &lsquo;ar'n't&rsquo;;
why don't you say &lsquo;ain't&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl mimicked Ellen's voice impishly.</p>

<p>Ellen colored. &ldquo;I am going to talk the way I think best, the
way I have been taught is right, and if that makes you think I am
stuck up, I can't help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, don't get mad. I didn't mean anything,&rdquo; said the
other girl.</p>

<p>All the time while Ellen was working, and even while the
exultation and enthusiasm of her first charge in the battle of labor
was upon her, she had had, since her feminine instincts were, after
all, strong with her, a sense that Robert Lloyd was under the same
great factory roof, in the same human hive, that he might at any
moment pass through the room. That, however, she did not think very
likely. She fancied the Lloyds seldom went through the departments,
which were in charge of foremen. Mr. Norman Lloyd was at the
mountains with his wife, she knew. They left Robert in charge, and he
would have enough to do in the office. She looked at the grimy men
working around her, and she thought of the elegant young fellow, and
the utter incongruity of her being among them seemed so great as to
preclude the possibility of it. She had said to herself when she
thought of obtaining work in Lloyd's that she need not hesitate about
it on account of Robert. She had heard her father say that the elder
Lloyd almost never came in contact with the men, that everything was
done through the foremen. She reasoned that it would be the same with
the younger Lloyd. But all at once the girl at her side gave her a
violent nudge, which did not interrupt for a second her own flying
fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;ain't he handsome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen glanced over her shoulder and saw Robert Lloyd coming down
between the lines of workmen. Then she turned to her work, and her
fingers slipped and bungled, her ears rang. He passed without
speaking.</p>

<p>Mamie Brady openly stared after him. &ldquo;He's awful handsome,
and an awful swell, but he's awful stuck up, just like the old
boss,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He never notices any of us, and acts as
if he was afraid we'd poison him. My, what's the matter with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look white as a sheet; ain't you well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen turned upon her with sudden fury. She had something of the
blood of the violent Louds and of her hot-tempered grandmother. She
had stood everything from this petty, insistent tormentor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I will thank
you to let me alone, and let me do my work, and do your
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other girl stared at her a minute with curiously expressive,
uplifted eyebrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; she said, in a half whistle then, and went on
with her work, and did not speak again.</p>

<p>Ellen was thankful that Robert Lloyd had not spoken to her in the
factory, and yet she was cut to the quick by it. It fulfilled her
anticipations to the letter. &ldquo;I was right,&rdquo; she said to
herself; &ldquo;he can never think of me again. He is showing
it.&rdquo;  Somehow, after he had passed, her enthusiasm, born of a
strong imagination, and her breadth of nature failed her somewhat.
The individual began to press too closely upon the aggregate.
Suddenly Ellen Brewster and her own heartache and longing came to the
front. She had put herself out of his life as completely as if she
had gone to another planet. Still, feeling this, she realized no
degradation of herself as a cause of it. She realized that from his
point of view she had gone into a valley, but from hers she was
rather on an opposite height. She on the height of labor, of skilled
handiwork, which is the manifestation in action of brain-work, he on
the height of pure brain-work unpressed by physical action.</p>

<p>At noon, when she was eating her dinner with Abby and Maria, Abby
turned to her and inquired if young Mr. Lloyd had spoken to her when
he came through the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he didn't,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>Abby said nothing, but she compressed her lips and gave her head a
hard jerk. A girl who ran a machine next to Abby's came up, munching
a large piece of pie, taking clean semicircular bites with her large,
white teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you see the young boss's
new suit? Got up fine, wasn't he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd like to see him working where I be for an hour,&rdquo;
said a young fellow, strolling up, dipping into his dinner-bag. He
was black and greasy as to face and hands and clothing. &ldquo;Guess
his light pants and vest would look rather different,&rdquo; said he,
and everybody laughed except the Atkins girls and Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he washed his hands, anyway, before he ate his
dinner,&rdquo; said Abby, sharply, looking at the young man's hands
with meaning.</p>

<p>The young fellow colored, though he laughed. &ldquo;There ain't a
knife in this shop so sharp as some women's tongues,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I pity the man that gets you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There won't be any man get me,&rdquo; retorted Abby.
&ldquo;I've seen all I want to see of men, working with 'em every
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe they have of you,&rdquo; called back the young
fellow, going away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The saucy thing!&rdquo; said the girl who stitched next to
Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn't any excuse for a man's eating his dinner with
hands like that,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;It's worse to poison
yourself with your own dirt than with other folks'. It hurts your own
self more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain't worth minding,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I do mind him?&rdquo; returned Abby. Maria
looked at her meaningly. The young man, whose name was Edison
Bartlett, had once tried to court Abby, but neither she nor Maria had
ever told of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His clothes were a pearl gray,&rdquo; said the girl at the
stitching-machine, reverting to the original subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, who cares what color they were?&rdquo; cried
Abby, impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked awful handsome in 'em,&rdquo; said the girl.
&ldquo;He's awful handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better look at handsome fellows in your own set,
Sadie Peel,&rdquo; said Abby, roughly.</p>

<p>The girl, who was extremely pretty, carried herself well, and
dressed with cheap fastidiousness, colored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see what we have to think about sets for,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;I guess way back the Peels were as good as the
Lloyds. We're in a free country, where one is as good as another,
ain't we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is as good as another, except in the sight of the
Lord, in any country on the face of this earth,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are as good in your own sight, I don't see that it
makes much difference about the sight of other human beings,&rdquo;
said Ellen. &ldquo;I guess that's what makes a republic,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sadie Peel gave a long, bewildered look at her, then she turned to
Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where I can get somebody to do
accordion-plaiting for me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;I never expect to get to the
height of accordion-plaiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where you can,&rdquo; said another girl, coming up.
She had light hair, falling in a harsh, uncurled bristle over her
forehead; her black gown was smeared with paste, and even her face
and hands were sticky with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a great splash of paste on your nose, Hattie
Wright,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>The girl took out a crumpled handkerchief and began rubbing her
nose absently while she went on talking about the
accordion-plaiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a woman on Joy Street does it,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;She lives just opposite the school-house, and she does it
awful cheap, only three cents a yard.&rdquo;  She thrust the
handkerchief into her pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven't got it half off,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it stay there, then,&rdquo; said the girl,
indifferently. &ldquo;If you work pasting linings in a shoe-shop
you've got to get pasted yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked at the girl with a curious reflection that she spoke
the truth, that she really was pasted herself, that the soil and the
grind of her labor were wearing on her soul. She had seen this girl
out of the shop&mdash;in fact, only the day before&mdash;and no one
would have known her for the same person. When her light hair was
curled, and she was prettily dressed, she was quite a beauty. In the
shop she was a slattern, and seemed to go down under the wheels of
her toil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Joy Street, you said?&rdquo; said Sadie Peel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Right opposite the school-house. Her name is
Brackett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the one-o'clock whistle blew, and everybody, Ellen with the
rest, went back to their stations. Robert Lloyd did not come into the
room again that afternoon. Ellen worked on steadily, and gained
swiftness. Every now and then the foreman came and spoke
encouragingly to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, Mamie,&rdquo; he said to the girl at her side,
&ldquo;or she'll get ahead of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want to get ahead of her,&rdquo; said Ellen,
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Flynn laughed. &ldquo;If you don't, you ain't much like the other
girls in this shop,&rdquo; said he, passing on with his urbane,
slightly important swing of shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mean that?&rdquo; asked Mamie Brady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. It seems to me you work fast enough for any
girl. A girl isn't a machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're a queer thing,&rdquo; said Mamie Brady. &ldquo;If I
were you, I would just as soon get ahead as not, especially if Ed
Flynn was goin' to come and praise me for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen shrugged her shoulders and tied another knot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're a queer thing,&rdquo; said Mamie Brady, while her
fingers flew like live wires.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXVI</h3>

<p>That night, when Ellen went down the street towards home with the
stream of factory operatives, she computed that she must have earned
about fifty cents, perhaps not quite that. She was horribly tired.
Although the work in itself was not laborious, she had been all day
under a severe nervous tension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look tired to death, Ellen Brewster,&rdquo; Abby said,
in a half-resentful, half-compassionate tone. &ldquo;You can never
stand this in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no more tired than any one would be the first
day,&rdquo; Ellen returned, stoutly, &ldquo;and I'm going to stand
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You act to me as if you liked it,&rdquo; said Abby, with an
angry switch like a cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Ellen returned, almost as angrily. Then she
turned to Abby. &ldquo;Look here, Abby Atkins, why can't you treat me
half-way decent?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You know I've got to do it,
and I'm making the best of it. If anybody else treated me the way you
are doing, I don't know what you would do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would kill them,&rdquo; said Abby, fiercely; &ldquo;but
it's different with me. I'm mad to have you go to work in the shop,
and act as if you liked it, because I think so much of you.&rdquo;
Abby and Ellen were walking side by side, and Maria followed with
Sadie Peel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can't help it if you are mad at me,&rdquo; said
Ellen. &ldquo;I've had everything to contend against, my father and
mother, and my grandmother won't even speak to me, and now if
you&mdash;&rdquo;  Ellen's voice broke.</p>

<p>Abby caught her arm in a hard grip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you can depend on me. You
know you can, in spite of everything. You know why I talk so. If
you've set your heart on doing it, I won't say another word. I'll do
all I can to help you, and I'd like to hear anybody say a word
against you for going to work in the shop, that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen and Abby almost never kissed each other; Abby was not given
to endearments of that kind. Maria was more profuse with her
caresses. That night when they reached the corner of the cross street
where the Atkinses lived, Maria went close to Ellen and put up her
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said she. Then she withdrew her lips
suddenly, before Ellen could touch them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You mustn't kiss me. I
forgot my cough. They say it's catching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen caught hold of her little, thin shoulders, held her firmly,
and kissed her full on her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Ellen,&rdquo; called Abby, and her sharp voice
rang as sweet as a bird's.</p>

<p>When Ellen came in sight of her grandmother's house, she saw a
window-shade go down with a jerk, and knew that Mrs. Zelotes had been
watching for her, and was determined not to let her know it. Mrs.
Pointdexter came out of her grand house as Ellen passed, and took up
her station on the corner to wait for a car. She bowed to Ellen with
an evasive, little, sidewise bow. Her natural amiability prompted her
to shake hands with her, call her &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo; and inquire
how she had got on during her first day in the factory, but she was
afraid of her friend, whose eye she felt upon her around the edge of
the drawn curtain.</p>

<p>It was unusually dark that night for early fall, and the rain came
down in a steady drizzle, as it had come all day, and the wind blew
from the ocean on the east. The lamp was lighted in the kitchen when
Ellen turned into her own door-yard, and home had never looked so
pleasant and desirable to her. For the first time in her life she
knew what it was to come home for rest and shelter after a day of
toil, and she seemed to sense the full meaning of home as a refuge
for weary labor.</p>

<p>When she opened the door, she smelled at once a particular kind of
stew of which she was very fond, and knew that her mother had been
making it for her supper. There was a rush of warm air from the
kitchen which felt grateful after the damp chill outside.</p>

<p>Ellen went into the kitchen, and her mother stood there over the
stove, stirring the stew. She looked up at the girl with an
expression of intense motherliness which was beyond a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so you've got home?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. It isn't hard work. Not a bit hard,
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't you tired?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a little. But no more than anybody would be at first. I
don't look very tired, do I?&rdquo; Ellen laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don't,&rdquo; said Fanny, looking at her cheeks,
reddened with the damp wind. The mother's look was admiring and
piteous and brave. No one knew how the woman had suffered that day,
but she had kept her head and heart above it. The stew for Ellen's
supper was a proof of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's father?&rdquo; asked Ellen, taking off her hat and
cape, and going to the sink to wash her face and hands. Fanny saw her
do that with a qualm. Ellen had always used a dainty little set in
her own room. Now she was doing exactly as her father had always done
on his return from the shop&mdash;washing off the stains of leather
at the kitchen sink. She felt instinctively that Ellen did it
purposely, that she was striving to bring herself into accord with
her new life in all the details.</p>

<p>Little Amabel came running out of the dining-room, and threw her
arms around Ellen's knees as she was bending over the sink.
&ldquo;I've set the table!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out or you'll get all splashed,&rdquo; laughed
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I dusted,&rdquo; said Amabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's been as good as a kitten all day, and a sight of
help,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's a good girl,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;Cousin Ellen
will kiss her as soon as she gets her face washed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She caught hold of a fold of the roller towel, and turned her
beautiful, dripping face to her mother as she did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That stew does smell so good,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Where
did you say father was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought we'd just have some bread and milk for dinner,
and somethin' hearty to-night, when you came home,&rdquo; said Fanny.
&ldquo;I thought maybe a stew would taste good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it will,&rdquo; said Ellen, stooping down to kiss
Amabel. &ldquo;Where did you say father was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Andrew has been lyin' down all day most,&rdquo;
whispered Amabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't he well?&rdquo; Ellen asked her mother, in quick
alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he's well enough.&rdquo;  Fanny moved close to the
girl with a motion of secrecy. &ldquo;If I were you I wouldn't say
one word about the shop, nor what you did, before father to-night;
let him kind of get used to it. Amabel mustn't talk about it,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't,&rdquo; said Amabel, with a wise air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know father had set his heart on somethin' pretty
different for you,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>Fanny hushed her voice as Andrew came out of the dining-room,
staggering a little as if the light blinded him. His nervous strength
of the morning had passed and left him exhausted. He moved and stood
with a downward lope of every muscle, expressing unutterable
patience, which had passed beyond rebellion and questioning.</p>

<p>He stood before Ellen like some old, spent horse. He was expecting
to hear something about the shop&mdash;expecting, as it were, a touch
on a sore, and he waited for it meekly.</p>

<p>Ellen turned her lovely, glowing face towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, as if nothing out of the common
had happened, &ldquo;are you going down-town to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew brightened a little. &ldquo;I can if you want anything,
Ellen,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't want you to go on purpose, but I do want a
book from the library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd just as soon go as not, Ellen,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It'll do him good,&rdquo; whispered Fanny, as she passed
Ellen, carrying the dish of stew to the dining-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I'll give you my card after supper,&rdquo; said
Ellen. &ldquo;Supper is ready now, isn't it, mother? I'm as hungry as
a bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew, when he was seated at the table and was ladling out the
stew, had still that air of hopeless and defenceless apology towards
life, but he held his head higher, and his frown of patient gloom had
relaxed.</p>

<p>Then Ellen said something else. &ldquo;Maybe I can write a book
some time,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>A sudden flash illumined Andrew's face. It was like the visible
awakening of hope and ambition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see why you can't,&rdquo; he said, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she can,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;Give her some more
of the potatoes, Andrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have plenty of time after&mdash;evenings,&rdquo; said
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess lots of folks write books that sell, and sell well,
that don't have any more talent than you,&rdquo; said Andrew.
&ldquo;Only think how they praised your valedictory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it can't do any harm to try,&rdquo; said Ellen,
&ldquo;and you could copy it for me, couldn't you, father? Your
writing is so fine, it would be as good as a typewriter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I can,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>When Andrew went down to the library, passing along the drenched
streets, seeing the lamps through shifting veils of heavy mist, he
was as full of enthusiasm over Ellen's book as he had been over the
gold-mine. The heart of a man is always ready to admit a ray of
sunshine, and it takes only a small one to dispel the shadows when
love dwells therein.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXVII</h3>

<p>Ellen actually went to work, with sheets of foolscap and a new
bottle of ink, on a novel, which was not worth the writing; but no
one could estimate the comfort and encouragement it was to Andrew.
Ellen worked an hour or two every evening on the novel, and next day
Andrew copied it in a hand like copperplate&mdash;large, with ornate
flourishes. Andrew's handwriting had always been greatly admired,
and, strangely enough, it was not in the least indicative of his
character, being wholly acquired. He had probably some ability for
drawing, but this had been his only outlet.</p>

<p>At the head of every chapter of Ellen's novel were birds and
flowers done in colored inks, and every chapter had a tail-piece of
elegant quirls and flourishes. Fanny admired it intensely. She was
not quite so sure of Ellen's work as she was of her husband's. She
felt herself a judge of one, but not of the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Ellen could only write as well as you copy, it will
do,&rdquo; she often said to Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What she is writing is beautiful,&rdquo; said Andrew,
fervently. He was quite sure in his own mind that such a book had
never been written, and his pride in his decorations was a minor
one.</p>

<p>Ellen, although she was not versed in the ways of books, yet had
enough of a sense of the fitness of things, and of the ridiculous, to
know that the manuscript, with its impossible pen-and-ink birds and
flowers heading and finishing every chapter, was grotesque in the
extreme. She felt divided between a desire to laugh and a desire to
cry whenever she looked at it. About her own work she felt more than
doubtful; still, she was somewhat hopeful, since her taste and
judgment, as well as her style, were alike crude. She told Abby and
Maria what she was doing, under promise of strict secrecy, and after
a while read them a few chapters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's beautiful,&rdquo; said Maria&mdash;&ldquo;perfectly
beautiful. I had a Sunday-school book this week which I know wasn't
half as good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked at Abby, who was silent. The three girls were up in
Ellen's room. It was midwinter, some months after she had gone to
work in the shop, and she had a fire in her little, air-tight
stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it, Abby?&rdquo; asked Ellen.
Ellen's cheeks were flushed as if with fever. She looked eagerly at
the other girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to tell you the truth?&rdquo; asked Abby,
bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I don't know a thing about books, and I'd knock
anybody else down that said it, but it seems to me it's
trash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Abby,&rdquo; murmured Maria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Ellen, though she quivered a
little, &ldquo;I want to know just how it looks to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks to me just like that,&rdquo; said
Abby&mdash;&ldquo;like trash. It sounds as if, when you began to
write it, you had mounted upon stilts, and didn't see things and
people the way they really were. It ain't natural.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I had better give it up, then?&rdquo; asked
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't, on account of your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it would about break father's heart,&rdquo; said
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know but it's worth as much to write a book for
your father, to please him, and keep his spirits up, as it is to
write one for the whole world,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only, of course, she can't get any money for it,&rdquo;
said Maria. &ldquo;But I don't believe Abby is right, and don't you
get discouraged, Ellen. It sounds beautiful to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it is worth keeping on with for father's
sake,&rdquo; said Ellen; but she had a discouraged air. She never
again wrote with any hope or heart; she had faith in Abby's opinion,
for she knew that she was always predisposed to admiration in her
case.</p>

<p>Ellen at that time was earning more, for she had advanced, and had
long ago left her station beside Mamie Brady; and now in a month or
two she would have a machine. The girls, many of them, said openly
that her rapid promotion was due to favoritism, and that Ed Flynn
wouldn't do as much for anybody but Ellen Brewster. Flynn hung about
her in the shop a good deal, but he had made no efforts to pay her
decided attention. His religion was the prime factor for his
hesitation. He could not see his way clear towards open addresses
with a view to marriage. Still, he had a sharp eye for other
admirers, and Ellen had not been in the factory two months before
Granville Joy was sent into another room. Robert Lloyd, to whom the
foreman appealed for confirmation of the plan, coincided with
readiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fellow ain't strong enough to run that machine he's
doing now,&rdquo; said Flynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then put him on another,&rdquo; Robert said, coloring. It
was not quite like setting his rival in the front of the battle;
still, he felt ashamed of himself. Quicker than lightning it had
flashed through his mind that young Joy could thus be sent into a
separate room from Ellen Brewster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he had better take one of the heel-shaving machines
below,&rdquo; said Flynn, &ldquo;and let that big Swede, that's as
strong as an ox, and never jumped at anything in his life, take his
place here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Lloyd, assuming a nonchalant air.
&ldquo;Make the change if you think it advisable, Flynn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While such benevolence towards a possible rival had its suspicious
points, yet there was, after all, some reason for it. Granville Joy,
who was delicately organized as to his nerves, was running a machine
for cutting linings, and this came down with sharp thuds which shook
the factory, and it was fairly torture to him. Every time the knife
fell he cringed as if at a cannon report. He had never grown
accustomed to it. His face had acquired a fixed expression of being
screwed to meet a shock of sound. He was manifestly unfit for his
job, but he received the order to leave with dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn't my work been satisfactory?&rdquo; he asked
Flynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Satisfactory enough,&rdquo; replied the foreman, genially,
&ldquo;but it's too hard for you, man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'ain't complained,&rdquo; said Joy, with a flash of his
eyes. He thought he knew why this solicitude was shown him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you 'ain't,&rdquo; said Flynn, &ldquo;but you 'ain't
got the muscle and nerve for it. That's plain enough to
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'ain't complained, and I'd rather stay where I be,&rdquo;
said Joy, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll go where you are sent in this factory, or be
damned,&rdquo; cried Flynn, walking off.</p>

<p>Joy looked after him with an expression which transformed his
face. But the next morning the stolid Swede, who would not have
started at a bomb, was at his place, and he was below, where he could
not see Ellen.</p>

<p>Robert never spoke to Ellen in the factory, and had never called
upon her since she entered. Now and then he met her on the street and
raised his hat, that was all. Still, he began to wonder more and more
if his aunt had not been mistaken in her view of the girl's motive
for giving up college and going to work. Then, later on, he learned
from Lyman Risley that a small mortgage had been put on the Brewster
house some time before. In fact, Andrew, not knowing to whom to go,
and remembering his kindness when Ellen was a child, had applied to
him for advice concerning it. &ldquo;He had to do it to keep his
wife's sister in the asylum,&rdquo; he told Robert; &ldquo;and that
poor girl went to work because she was forced into it, not because
she preferred it, you may be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men were walking down the street one wind-swept day in
December, when the pavement showed ridges of dust as from a mighty
broom, and travellers walked bending before it with backward-flying
garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;still, as Aunt
Cynthia says, so many girls have that idea of earning money instead
of going to school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the pitiful need of money has tainted many poor
girls with a monstrous and morbid overvalue of it,&rdquo; said
Risley, &ldquo;and for that I cannot see they are to blame; but in
this case I am sure it was not so. That poor child gave up Vassar
College and went to work because she was fairly forced into it by
circumstances. The aunt's husband ran away with another woman, and
left her destitute, so that the support of her and her child came
upon the Brewsters; and Brewster has been out of work a long time
now, I know. He told me so. That mortgage had to be raised, and the
girl had to go to work; there was no other way out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn't she tell Aunt Cynthia so?&rdquo; asked
Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she is Ellen Brewster, the outgrowth of the child
who would not&mdash;&rdquo;  Risley checked himself abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Robert, shortly.</p>

<p>The other man started. &ldquo;How long have you known&mdash;she
did not tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert laughed a little. &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Nobody told. I went there to call, and saw my own old doll
sitting in a little chair in a corner of the parlor. She did not
tell, but she knew that I knew. That child was a trump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what can you expect of a girl who was a child like
that?&rdquo; said Risley. &ldquo;Mind you, in a way I don't like it.
This power for secretiveness and this rigidity of pride in a girl of
that age strike me rather unpleasantly. Of course she was too proud
to tell Cynthia the true reason, and very likely thought they would
blame her father, or Cynthia might feel that she was in a measure
hinting to her to do more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have looked like that,&rdquo; said Robert,
reflecting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without any doubt that was what she thought; still, I don't
like this strength in so young a girl. She will make a more
harmonious woman than girl, for she has not yet grown up to her own
character. But depend upon it, that girl never went to work of her
own free choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say the father is out of work?&rdquo; Robert said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has not had work for six months. He said, with the
most dejected dignity and appeal that I ever saw in my life, that
they begin to think him too old, that the younger men are
preferred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Robert began, then he stopped confusedly.
It had been on his tongue to say that he wondered if he could not get
some employment for him at Lloyd's; then he remembered his uncle, and
stopped. Robert had begun to understand the older man's methods, and
also to understand that they were not to be cavilled at or disputed,
even by a nephew for whom he had undoubtedly considerable
affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nonsense, of course,&rdquo; said Risley. &ldquo;The
man is not by any means old or past his usefulness, although I must
admit he has that look. He cannot be any older than your uncle.
Speaking of your uncle, how is Mrs. Lloyd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear Aunt Lizzie is very far from well,&rdquo; replied
Robert, &ldquo;but she tries to keep it from Uncle Norman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see how she can. She looked ghastly when I met her
the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was when Uncle Norman was in New York,&rdquo; said
Robert. &ldquo;It is different when he is at home.&rdquo;  As he
spoke, an expression of intensest pity came over the young man's
face. &ldquo;I wonder what a woman who loves her husband will not do
to shield him from any annoyance or suffering,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe some women are born fixed to a sort of spiritual
rack for the sake of love, and remain there through life,&rdquo; said
Risley. &ldquo;But I have always liked Mrs. Lloyd. She ought to have
good advice. What is it, has she told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be quite safe with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert whispered one word in his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Risley, &ldquo;that? And do you mean to
say that she has had no advice except Dr. Story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I took her to New York to a specialist some time ago.
Uncle Norman never knew it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And nothing can be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could have an operation, but the success would be very
doubtful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that she will not consent to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she may live for years, but she suffers horribly, and
she will suffer more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you say he does not know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, look here, Robert, dare you assume the responsibility?
What will he say when he finds out that you have kept it from
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;I will not break
an oath exacted by a woman in such straits as that, and I don't see
what good it could do to tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might persuade her to have the operation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mere existence is persuasion enough, if she is to be
persuaded. And I hope she may consent before long. She has seemed a
little more comfortable lately, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose sometimes those hideous things go away as
mysteriously as they come,&rdquo; said Risley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Robert. &ldquo;Going back to our first
subject&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Risley laughed. &ldquo;Here she is coming,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>In fact, at that moment they came abreast the street that led to
the factories, and the six-o'clock whistle was just dying away in a
long reverberation, and the workmen pouring out of the doors and down
the stairs. Ellen had moved quickly, for she had an errand at the
grocery-store before she went home. She was going to get some oysters
for a hot stew for supper, of which her father was very fond. She had
a little oyster-can in her hand when she met the two gentlemen. She
had grown undeniably thinner since summer, but she was charming. Her
short black skirt and her coarse gray jacket fitted her as well as if
they had been tailor-made. There was nothing tawdry or slatternly
about her. She looked every inch a lady, even with the drawback of an
oyster-can, and mittens instead of gloves.</p>

<p>Both Risley and Robert raised their hats, and Ellen bowed. She did
not smile, but her face contracted curiously, and her color obviously
paled. Risley looked at Robert after they had passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have called on her twice,&rdquo; said Robert, as if
answering a question. His relations with the older man had become
very close, almost like those of father and son, though Risley was
hardly old enough for that relation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you haven't been since she went to work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you would have, had she gone to college instead of
going to work in a shoe-factory?&rdquo;  Risley's voice had a tone of
the gentlest conceivable sarcasm.</p>

<p>Robert colored. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; he said. Then he
turned to Risley with a burst of utter frankness. &ldquo;Hang it! old
fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know how I have been brought up;
you know how she&mdash;you know all about it. What is a fellow to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what he pleases. If it would please me to call on that
splendid young thing, I should call if I were the Czar of all the
Russias.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will call,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXVIII</h3>

<p>The very next evening Robert Lloyd went to call on Ellen. As he
started out he was conscious of a strange sensation of shock, as if
his feet had suddenly touched firm ground. All these months since
Ellen had been working in the factory he had been vacillating. He was
undoubtedly in love with her; he did not for a moment cheat himself
as to that. When he caught a glimpse of her fair head among the other
girls, he realized how unspeakably dear she was to him. Ellen never
entered nor left the factory that he did not know it. Without
actually seeing her, he was conscious of her presence always. He
acknowledged to himself that there was no one like her for him, and
never would be. He tried to interest himself in other young women,
but always there was Ellen, like the constant refrain of a song. All
other women meant to him not themselves, but Ellen. Womanhood itself
was Ellen for his manhood. He knew it, and yet that strain of utterly
impassionate judgment and worldly wisdom which was born in him kept
him from making any advances to her. Now, however, the radicalism of
Risley had acted like a spur to his own inclination. His judgment was
in abeyance. He said to himself that he would give it up; he would go
to see the girl&mdash;that he would win her if he could. He said to
himself that she had been wronged, that Risley was right about her,
that she was good and noble.</p>

<p>As the car drew near the Brewsters, his tenderness seemed to
outspeed the electricity. The girl's fair face was plain before his
eyes, as if she were actually there, and it was idealized and haloed
as with the light of gold and precious stones. All at once, since he
had given himself loose rein, he overtook, as it were, the true
meaning of her. &ldquo;The dear child,&rdquo; he thought, with a rush
of tenderness like pain&mdash;&ldquo;the dear child. There she gave
up everything and went to work, and let us blame her, rather than
have her father blamed. The dear, proud child. She did that rather
than seem to beg for more help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Robert got off the car he was ready to fall at her feet, to
push between her and the roughness of life, between her and the whole
world.</p>

<p>He went up the little walk between the dry shrubs and rang the
bell. There was no light in the front windows nor in the hall.
Presently he heard footsteps, and saw a glimmer of light advancing
towards him through the length of the hall. There were
muslin-curtained side-lights to the door. Then the door opened, and
little Amabel Tenny stood there holding a small kerosene lamp
carefully in both hands. She held it in such a manner that the light
streamed up in Robert's face and nearly blinded him. He was dimly
conscious of a little face full of a certain chary innocence and
pathos regarding him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Ellen Brewster at home?&rdquo; asked Robert,
smiling down at the little thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Amabel.</p>

<p>Then she remained perfectly still, holding the lamp, as if she had
been some little sculptured light-bearer. She did not return his
smile, and she did not ask him in. She simply regarded him with her
sharp, innocent, illuminated face. Robert felt ridiculously
nonplussed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say she was in, my dear?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Amabel, then relapsed into
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I see her?&rdquo; asked Robert, desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Amabel. Then she stood still,
as before, holding the lamp.</p>

<p>Robert began to wonder what he was to do, when he heard a woman's
voice calling from the sitting-room at the end of the hall, the door
of which had been left ajar:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amabel Tenny, what are you doin'? You are coldin' the house
all off! Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a man, Aunt Fanny,&rdquo; called Amabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the man?&rdquo; asked the voice. Then, much to
Robert's relief, Fanny herself appeared.</p>

<p>She colored a flaming red when she saw him. She looked at Amabel
as if she had an impulse to shake her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Lloyd, is it you?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Mrs. Brewster; is&mdash;is your daughter at
home?&rdquo; asked Robert. He felt inclined to roar with laughter,
and yet a curious dismay was beginning to take possession of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ellen is at home,&rdquo; replied Fanny, with alacrity.
&ldquo;Walk in, Mr. Lloyd.&rdquo;  She was blushing and smiling as if
she had been her own daughter. It was foolish, yet pathetic. Although
Fanny asked the young man to walk in, and snatched the lamp
peremptorily from Amabel's hand, she still hesitated. Robert began to
wonder if he should ever be admitted. He did not dream of the true
reason for the hesitation. There was no fire in the parlor, and in
the sitting-room were Andrew, John Sargent, and Mrs. Wetherhed. It
seemed to her highly important that Ellen should see her caller by
herself, but how to take him into that cold parlor?</p>

<p>Finally, however, she made up her mind to do so. She opened the
parlor door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please walk in this way, Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; said she, and
Robert followed her in.</p>

<p>It was a bitter night outside, and the temperature in the unused
room was freezing. The windows behind the cheap curtains were thickly
furred with frost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please be seated,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>She indicated the large easy-chair, and Robert seated himself
without removing his outer coat, yet the icy cold of the cushions
struck through him.</p>

<p>Fanny ignited a match to light the best lamp with its painted
globe. Her fingers trembled. She had to use three matches before she
was successful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't I assist you?&rdquo; asked Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Fanny; &ldquo;I guess the
matches are damp. I've got it now.&rdquo;  Her voice shook. She
turned to Robert when the lamp was lighted, still holding the small
one, which she had set for the moment on the table. The strong double
light revealed her face of abashed delight, although the young man
did not understand it. It was the solicitude of the mother for the
child which dignified all coarseness and folly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you had better keep on your overcoat a little while
till I get the fire built,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;This room ain't
very warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert tried to say something polite about not feeling cold, but
the lie was too obvious. Instead, he remarked that his coat was very
warm, as it was, indeed, being lined with fur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have the fire kindled in a minute,&rdquo; Fanny
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don't trouble yourself, Mrs. Brewster,&rdquo; said
Robert. &ldquo;I am quite warm in this coat, unless,&rdquo; he added,
lamely, &ldquo;I could go out where you were sitting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's company out there,&rdquo; said Fanny, with
embarrassed significance. She blushed as she spoke, and Robert
blushed also, without knowing why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no trouble at all to start a fire,&rdquo; said Fanny;
&ldquo;this chimney draws fine. I'll speak to Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert, left alone in the freezing room, felt his dismay deepen.
Barriers of tragedy are nothing to those of comedy. He began to
wonder if he were not, after all, doing a foolish thing. The hall
door had been left ajar, and he presently became aware of Amabel's
little face and luminous eyes set therein.</p>

<p>Robert smiled, and to his intense astonishment the child made a
little run to him and snuggled close to his side. He lifted her up on
his knee, and wrapped his fur coat around her. Amabel thrust out one
tiny hand and began to stroke the sable collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's fur,&rdquo; said she, with a bright, wise look into
Robert's face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it's fur,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do you know what
kind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head, with bright eyes still on his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is sable,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;and it is the coat
of a little animal that lives very far north, where it is as cold and
colder than this all the time, and the ice and snow never
melts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Amabel slipped off his knee, pushing aside his caressing
arm with a violent motion. Then she stood aloof, eying him with
unmistakable reproof and hostility. Robert laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he do without his coat if it is as cold as that
where he lives?&rdquo; asked Amabel, severely. There was almost an
accent of horror in her childish voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear child,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;the little
animal is dead. He isn't running around without his coat. He was shot
for his fur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make you a coat?&rdquo; Amabel's voice was full of
judicial severity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in one way,&rdquo; replied Robert, laughing.
&ldquo;It was shot to get the fur to make somebody a coat, and I
bought it. Come back here and have it wrapped round you; you'll
freeze if you don't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amabel came back and sat on his knee, and let him wrap the
fur-lined garment around her. A strange sensation of tenderness and
protection came over the young man as he felt the little, slender
body of the child nestle against his own. He had begun to surmise who
she was. However, Amabel herself told him in a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mamma's sick, and they took her to an asylum. And my
papa has gone away,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor little soul,&rdquo; said Robert, tenderly. Amabel
continued to look at him with eyes of keenest intelligence, while one
little cheek was flattened against his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I live with Uncle Andrew and Aunt Fanny now,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;and I sleep with Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you like living here, don't you, you dear?&rdquo; asked
Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Amabel, &ldquo;and I like to stay with
Ellen, but&mdash;but&mdash;I want to see my mamma and papa,&rdquo;
she wailed, suddenly, in the lowest and most pitiful wail
imaginable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little darling,&rdquo; said Robert, stroking her
flaxen hair. Amabel looked up at him with her little face all
distorted with grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had been my papa, would you have gone away and left
Amabel?&rdquo; she asked, quiveringly. Robert gathered her to him in
a strong clasp of protection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you little darling, I never should,&rdquo; he cried,
fervently.</p>

<p>At that moment he wished devoutly that he had the handling of the
man who had deserted this child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you most as well as my own papa,&rdquo; said Amabel.
&ldquo;You ain't so big as my papa.&rdquo;  She said that in a tone
of evident disparagement.</p>

<p>Then the sitting-room door opened, and Fanny and Ellen and Andrew
appeared, the last with a great basket of wood and kindlings.</p>

<p>Robert set down Amabel, and sprang to his feet to greet Andrew and
Ellen. Andrew, after depositing his basket beside the stove, shook
hands with a sort of sad awkwardness. Robert saw that the man had
aged immeasurably since he had last seen him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a cold night, Mr. Brewster,&rdquo; he said, and knew
the moment he said it that it was not a happy remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pretty cold,&rdquo; agreed Andrew, &ldquo;and it's
cold here in this room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it'll be warm in a minute; this stove heats up
quick,&rdquo; cried Fanny, with agitated briskness. She began pulling
the kindlings out of the basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you let me do that,&rdquo; said Andrew, and was down
on his knees beside her. The two were cramming the fuel into the
little, air-tight stove, while Robert was greeting Ellen. The
awkwardness of the situation was evidently overcoming her. She was
quite pale, and her voice trembled as she returned his good-evening.
Amabel left the young man, and clung tightly to Ellen's hand, drawing
her skirt around her until only her little face was visible above the
folds.</p>

alt="The awkwardness of the situation was evidently overcoming her"></a>
</div>

<p>The fumes from a match filled the room, and the fire began to
roar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It'll be warm in a minute,&rdquo; said Fanny, rising.
&ldquo;You leave the register open till it's real good and hot,
Ellen, and there's plenty more wood in the basket. Here, Amabel, you
come out in the other room with Aunt Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Amabel, instead of obeying, made a dart towards Robert, who
caught her up, laughing, and smuggled her into the depths of his
fur-lined coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right along, Amabel,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>But Amabel clung fast to Robert, with a mischievous roll of an eye
at her aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amabel,&rdquo; said Fanny, authoritatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Amabel,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let her stay,&rdquo; Robert said, laughing. &ldquo;I'll
keep her in my coat until it is warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid she'll bother you,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a naughty girl, Amabel,&rdquo; said Fanny; but she
went out of the room, with Andrew at her heels. She did not know what
else to do, since the young man had expressed a desire to keep the
child. She had thought he would have preferred a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Ellen. Ellen sat down on
the sofa covered with olive-green plush, beyond the table, and the
light of the hideous lamp fell full upon her face. She was thin, and
much of her lovely bloom was missing between her agitation and the
cold; but Robert, looking at her, realized how dear she was to him.
There was something about that small figure, and that fair head held
with such firmness of pride, and that soul outlooking from steady
blue eyes, which filled all his need of life. His love for the pearl
quite ignored its setting of the common and the ridiculous. He looked
at her and smiled. Ellen smiled back tremulously, then she cast down
her eyes. The fire was roaring, but the room was freezing. The
sitting-room door was opened a crack, and remained so for a second,
then it was widened, and Andrew peeped in. Then he entered, tiptoeing
gingerly, as if he were afraid of disturbing a meeting. He brought a
blue knitted shawl, which he put over Ellen's shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother thinks you had better keep this on till the room
gets warm,&rdquo; he whispered. Then he withdrew, shutting the door
softly.</p>

<p>Robert, left alone with Ellen in this solemnly important fashion,
felt utterly at a loss. He had never considered himself especially
shy, but an embarrassment which was almost ridiculous was over him.
Ellen sat with her eyes cast down. He felt that the child on his knee
was regarding them both curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have come to see Ellen, why don't you speak to
her?&rdquo; demanded Amabel, suddenly. Then both Robert and Ellen
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is your aunt's little girl, isn't she?&rdquo; asked
Robert.</p>

<p>Amabel answered before Ellen was able. &ldquo;My mamma is sick,
and they carried her away to the asylum,&rdquo; she told Robert.
&ldquo;She&mdash;she tried to hurt Amabel; she tried
to&rdquo;&mdash;Amabel made that hideous gesture with her tiny
forefinger across her throat. &ldquo;Mamma was sick or she
wouldn't,&rdquo; she added, challengingly, to Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she wouldn't, you poor little soul,&rdquo; said
Robert.</p>

<p>Suddenly Amabel burst into tears, and began to wriggle herself
free from his arms. &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she demanded; &ldquo;let
me go. I want Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Robert loosened his grasp she fled to Ellen, and was in her
lap with a bound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my mamma&mdash;I want my mamma,&rdquo; she
moaned.</p>

<p>Ellen leaned her cheek against the poor little flaxen head.
&ldquo;There, there, darling,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;don't.
Mamma will come home as soon as she gets better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will that be, Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon, I hope, darling. Don't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Eva Tenny had been in the asylum some four months, and the
reports as to her condition were no more favorable. Ellen's voice, in
spite of herself, had a hopeless tone, which the child was quick to
detect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my mamma,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I want her,
Ellen. It has been to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow after
that, and the to-morrows are yesterdays, and she hasn't
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will come some time, darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert sat eying the two with intensest pity. &ldquo;Do you like
chocolates, Amabel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The child repeated that she wanted her mother still, as with a
sort of mechanical regularity of grief, but she fastened her eyes on
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am going to send you a big box of them
to-morrow,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>Amabel turned to Ellen. &ldquo;Does he mean it?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; replied Ellen, laughing.</p>

<p>Amabel, looking from one to the other, also began to laugh
unwillingly.</p>

<p>Then the sitting-room door opened, and Fanny called sharply and
imperatively, &ldquo;Amabel, Amabel; come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amabel clung more tightly to Ellen, who began to gently loosen her
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amabel Tenny, come this minute. It is your bed-time,&rdquo;
said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you had better go, darling,&rdquo; whispered
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want to go to bed till you do, Ellen,&rdquo;
whispered the child.</p>

<p>Ellen gently but firmly unclasped the clinging arms. &ldquo;Run
along, dear,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will send those chocolates to-morrow,&rdquo; suggested
Robert.</p>

<p>Amabel seemed to do everything by sudden and violent impulses. All
at once she ceased resisting. She slid down from Ellen's lap as
quickly as she had gotten into it. She clutched her neck with two
little wiry arms, kissed her hard on the mouth, darted across the
room to Robert, threw her arms around his neck and kissed him, then
flew out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is an interesting child,&rdquo; said Robert, who felt,
like most people, the delicate flattery of a child's unsolicited
caresses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very fond of her,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>Then the two were silent. Robert suddenly realized that there was
little to say unless he ventured on debatable ground. It would be too
absurd of him to commence making love at once, and as for asking
Ellen about her work, that seemed a subject better let alone.</p>

<p>Ellen herself opened the conversation by inquiring for his
aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Cynthia is very well,&rdquo; replied Robert. &ldquo;I
was in there last evening. You have not been to see her lately, Miss
Brewster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert realized as soon as he had said that that he had made a
mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ellen. She obviously paled a little, and
looked at him wistfully. The young man could not stand it any longer,
so straight into the heart of the matter he lunged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Miss Brewster,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why on
earth didn't you tell Aunt Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her?&rdquo; repeated Ellen, vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; make a clean breast of it to her. Tell her just why
you went to work, and gave up college?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen colored, and looked at him half defiantly, half piteously.
&ldquo;I told her all I ought to,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not; pardon me,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;you
did not tell her half enough. You let her think that you actually of
your own free choice went to work in the factory rather than go to
college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; replied Ellen, looking at him proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you did, in one sense, but in another you did
not. You deliberately chose to make a sacrifice; but it was a
sacrifice. You cannot deny that it was a sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you gave Aunt Cynthia the impression that it was not a
sacrifice,&rdquo; said Robert, almost severely.</p>

<p>Ellen's face quivered a little. &ldquo;I saw no other way to
do,&rdquo; she said, faintly. The authoritative tone which this young
man was taking with her stirred her as nothing had ever stirred her
in her life before. She felt like a child before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no right to give such a false impression of your
own character,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was either that or a false impression of another,&rdquo;
returned Ellen, tremulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that she might have blamed your parents, and
thought that they were forcing you into this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you thought, too, that maybe Aunt Cynthia
would suspect, if you told her all the difficulties, that you were
hinting for more assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded, and her lip was quivering. Suddenly all her force of
character seemed to have deserted her, and she looked more like a
child than Amabel. She actually put both her little fists to her
eyes. After all, the girl was very young, a child forced by the
stress of circumstances to premature development, but she could
relapse before the insistence of another nature.</p>

<p>Robert looked at her, his own face working, then he could bear it
no longer. He was over on the sofa beside Ellen and had her in his
arms. &ldquo;You poor little thing,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Don't. I have loved you ever since the first time I saw you. I
ought to have told you so before. Don't you love me a little,
Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen released herself with a motion of firm elusiveness and
looked at him. The tears still stood in her eyes, but her face was
steady. &ldquo;I have been putting you out of my mind,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But could you?&rdquo; whispered Robert, leaning over
her.</p>

<p>Ellen did not reply, but looked down and trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you?&rdquo; repeated Robert, and there was in his
voice that masculine insistence which is a true note of nature, and
means the subjugation of the feminine into harmony.</p>

<p>Ellen did not speak, but every line in her body betrayed helpless
yielding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know you could not,&rdquo; said Robert with triumph,
and took her in his arms again.</p>

<p>But he reckoned without the girl, who was, after all, stronger
than her natural instincts, and able to rise above and subjugate
them. She freed herself from him resolutely, rose, and stood before
him, looking at him quite unfalteringly and accusingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you come now?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You say you
have loved me from the first. You came to see me, you walked home
with me, and said things to me that made me think&mdash;&rdquo;  She
stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made you think what, dear?&rdquo; asked Robert. He was pale
and indescribably anxious and appealing. It was suddenly revealed to
him that this plum was so firmly attached to its bough of
individuality that possibly love itself could not loosen it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made me think that perhaps you did care a
little,&rdquo; said Ellen, in a low but unfaltering voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thought quite right, only not a little, but a great
deal,&rdquo; said Robert, firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;the moment I gave up going
to college and went to work you never came to see me again; you never
even spoke to me in the shop; you went right past me without a
look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God! child,&rdquo; Robert interposed, &ldquo;don't you
know why I did that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked at him bewildered, then a burning red overspread her
face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I didn't. But I do now.
They would have talked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would understand that,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;I had only the best motives for that. I cannot speak to you in
the factory any more than I have done. I cannot expose you to remark;
but as for my not calling, I believed what you said to my aunt and to
me. I thought that you had deliberately preferred a lower life to a
higher one&mdash;that you preferred earning money to something
better. I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert fairly started as Ellen began talking with a fire which
seemed to make her scintillate before his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk about a lower and a higher life,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Is it true? Is Vassar College any higher than a shoe-factory?
Is any labor which is honest, and done with the best strength of man,
for the best motives, to support the lives of those he loves, or to
supply the needs of his race, any higher than another? Where would
even books be without this very labor which you despise&mdash;the
books which I should have learned at college? Instead of being
benefited by the results of labor, I have become part of labor. Why
is that lower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert stared at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to feel all this since I went to work,&rdquo;
said Ellen, speaking in a high, rapid voice. &ldquo;When I went to
work, it was, as you thought, for my folks, to help them, for my
father was out of work, and there was no other way. But since I have
been at work I have realized what work really is. There is a glory
over it, as there is over anything which is done faithfully on this
earth for good motives, and I have seen the glory, and I am not
ashamed of it; and while it was a sacrifice at first, now, while I
should like the other better, I do not think it is. I am proud of my
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl spoke with a sort of rapt enthusiasm. The young man
stared, bewildered.</p>

<p>Robert caught Ellen's little hands, which hung, tightly clinched,
in the folds of her dress, and drew her down to his side again.
&ldquo;See here, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;maybe you are right. I
never looked at it in this way before, but you do not understand. I
love you; I want to marry you. I want to make you my wife, and lift
you out of this forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then again Ellen freed herself, and straightened her head and
faced him. &ldquo;There is nothing for me to be lifted out of,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;You speak as if I were in a pit. I am on a
height.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God! child, how many others feel as you, do you think,
out of the whole lot?&rdquo; cried Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Ellen, &ldquo;but it is true.
What I feel is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert caught up her little hand and kissed it. Then he looked at
its delicate outlines. &ldquo;Well, it may be true,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but look at yourself. Can't you see that you are not fashioned
for manual labor? Look at this little hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That little hand can do the work,&rdquo; Ellen replied,
proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dear,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;admitting all this,
admitting that you are not in a position to be lifted&mdash;admitting
everything&mdash;let us come back to our original starting-point.
Dear, I love you, and I want you for my wife. Will you marry
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I never can,&rdquo; replied Ellen, with a long, sobbing
breath of renunciation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? Don't you love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I think it must be true that I do. I said I wouldn't;
I have tried not to, but I think it must be true that I
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why not marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it will be impossible for my father and mother to
get along and support Amabel and Aunt Eva without my help,&rdquo;
said Ellen, directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo; began Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I will burden you with the support of a whole
family?&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, you don't know what I would be willing to do if I
could have you,&rdquo; cried the young man, fervently. And he was
quite in earnest. At that moment it seemed to him that he could even
come and live there in that house, with the hideous lamp, and the
crushed-plush furniture, and the eager mother; that he could go
without anything and everything to support them if only he could have
this girl who was fairly storming his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't be willing to have you,&rdquo; said Ellen,
firmly. &ldquo;As things are now I cannot marry you, Mr. Lloyd. Then,
too,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you asked me just now how many people
looked at all this labor as I do, and I dare say not very many. I
know not many of your kind of people. I know how your uncle looks at
it. It would hurt you socially to marry a girl from a shoe-shop.
Whether it is just or not, it would hurt you. It cannot be, as
matters are now, Mr. Lloyd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen suddenly, as if pushed by some mighty force outside herself,
leaned towards him, and he caught her in his arms. He tipped back her
face and kissed her, and looked down at her masterfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will wait a little,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will never
give you up as long as I live if you love me, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XXXIX</h3>

<p>When Ellen went out into the sitting-room that evening, after
Robert Lloyd had taken leave, her father and mother were still there,
although the callers had gone. Both of them looked furtively at her
as she went through the room to the kitchen to get a lamp, then they
looked at each other. Fanny was glowing with half shamefaced triumph;
Andrew was pale. Ellen did not re-enter the room, but simply paused
at the door, before going up-stairs, and they had a vision of a face
in a tumult of emotions, with eyes and hair illuminated to excess of
brilliancy by the lamp which she held.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she called, and her voice did not sound
like her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something has happened,&rdquo; Fanny whispered to Andrew,
when Ellen's chamber door had closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose she's goin' to?&rdquo; whispered Andrew, in
a sort of breathless fashion. His eyes on his wife's face were sad
and wistful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! How do I know?&rdquo; asked Fanny. &ldquo;I always
told you he liked her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Fanny looked disturbed. Presently she went out in the
kitchen to mix up some bread, and she wept a little, standing in a
corner, with her face hidden in the folds of an old shawl which hung
there on a peg. Dictatorial towards circumstances as she was when her
beloved daughter came in question, and proud as she was at the
prospect of an advantageous marriage for her, she remembered her
sister in the asylum, she remembered how Andrew was out of work, and
she could not understand how it was to be managed. And all this was
aside from the grief which she would have felt in any case at losing
Ellen.</p>

<p>As for Andrew, the next morning he put on his best clothes and
went by trolley-cars to the next manufacturing town, not a city like
Rowe, but a busy little place with two large factories, and tried in
vain to get a job there. As he came home on the crowded car, his face
was so despairing that the people looked curiously at him. Andrew had
always been mild and peaceable, but at that moment anarchistic
principles began to ferment in him. When a portly man, swelling
ostentatiously with broadcloth and fine linen, wearing a silk hat,
and carrying a gold-headed cane like a wand of office, got into the
car, Andrew looked at him with a sidelong glance which was almost
murderous. The spiritual bomb, which is in all our souls for our
fellow-men, began to swell towards explosion. This man was the
proprietor of one of the great factories in Leavitt, the town where
Andrew had vainly sought a job. He had been in the office when Andrew
entered, and the latter had heard his low voice of instruction to the
foreman that the man was too old. The manufacturer, who weighed
heavily, and described a vast curve of opulence from silk hat to his
patent-leathers, sat opposite, his gold-headed cane planted in the
aisle, his countenance a blank of complacent power. Andrew felt that
he hated him.</p>

<p>The man's face was not intellectual, not as intellectual as
Andrew's. He gave the impression of the force of matter oncoming and
irresistible, some inertia which had started Heaven knew how. This
man had inherited great wealth, as Andrew knew. He had capital with
which to begin, and he had strength to roll the accumulating ball.
Andrew felt more and more how he hated this man. He had told his
foreman that Andrew was too old, and Andrew knew that he was no
older, if as old, as the man himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had been born under the Czar, and done with it, I
should have felt differently,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;But who
is this man? What right has he to say that his fellow-men shall or
shall not? Does even his own property give him the right of dictation
over others? What is property? Is it anything but a temporary lease
while he draws the breath of life? What of it in the tomb, to which
he shall surely come? Shall a temporary possession give a man the
right to wield eternal power? For the power of giving or withholding
the means of life may produce eternal results.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the man rose and moved down the car, oscillating heavily,
steadying himself with his gold-headed cane, and got out in front of
a portentous mansion, Andrew would scarcely have recognized the look
in his own eyes had he seen himself in a mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That chap is pretty well fixed,&rdquo; said a man next him,
to one on the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cool half-million,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; said the first speaker. &ldquo;His
father left him half a million to start with, besides the business,
and he's been piling up ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you work there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did, but I had what was mighty nigh a sunstroke last
summer; had to quit. It was damned hot up there under the roof. It's
the same old factory his father had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goin' to work again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next week, if I'm able, but I dun'no' whether I can stay
there longer than till spring. It's damned hot up there under the
roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who spoke had a leaden hue of face, something ghastly, as
if the deadly heat had begun a work of decomposition. Andrew looked
at him, and his hatred against the rich man who had built himself a
stately mansion, and kept his fellow-creatures at work for him in an
unhealthy factory in tropical heat, and had condemned him for being
too old, was redoubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew Brewster, where have you been?&rdquo; Fanny asked,
when he got home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've been to Leavitt,&rdquo; answered Andrew, shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see if you could get a job there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny did not ask if he had been successful. She sighed, and took
another stitch in the wrapper which she was making. That sigh almost
drove Andrew mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see what has got you into such a habit of
sighing,&rdquo; he said, brutally.</p>

<p>Fanny looked at him with reproachful anger. &ldquo;Andrew
Brewster, you ain't like yourself,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's no need for you to pitch into me because you can't
get work; I ain't to blame. I'm doing all I can. I won't stand it,
and you might as well know it first as last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny glared angrily at her husband, then the tears sprang to her
eyes.</p>

<p>Andrew hesitated a moment, then he leaned over her and put his
thin cheek against her rough black hair. &ldquo;The Lord knows I
don't mean to be harsh to you, you poor girl,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but I wish I was dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny seemed to spring into resistance like a wire. &ldquo;Then
you are a coward, Andrew Brewster,&rdquo; said she, hotly.
&ldquo;Talk about wishin' you was dead. I 'ain't got time to die.
You'd 'nough sight better go out into the yard and split up some of
that wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't mean to speak so, Fanny,&rdquo; said Andrew,
&ldquo;but sometimes I get desperate, and I've been thinking of
Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you suppose I have?&rdquo; asked Fanny, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there's one thing about it; we won't stand in her
way,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we won't,&rdquo; replied Fanny. &ldquo;I'll go out
washing first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hasn't said anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As time went on Ellen still said nothing. She had made a curious
compact for a young girl with her lover. She had stipulated that no
engagement was to exist, that she should be perfectly free&mdash;when
she said that she thought of Maud Hemingway, but she said it without
a tremor&mdash;and if years hence both were free and of the same mind
they might talk of it again.</p>

<p>Robert had rebelled strenuously. &ldquo;You know this will shut me
off from seeing much of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know I told
you how it will be about my even talking much to you in the
factory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand that now,&rdquo; replied Ellen, blushing;
&ldquo;and I understand, too, that you cannot come to see me very
often under such circumstances without making talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often?&rdquo; Robert asked, impetuously.</p>

<p>Ellen hesitated, her lip quivered a little, but her voice was
firm. &ldquo;Not oftener than two or three times a year, I am
afraid,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; cried Robert. Then he caught her in his
arms again. &ldquo;Do you suppose I can stand that?&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;Ellen, I cannot consent to this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the only way,&rdquo; said she. She freed herself from
him enough to look into his eyes with a brave, fearless gaze of
comradeship, which somehow seemed to make her dearer than anything
else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to see you to speak to only two or three times a
year!&rdquo; groaned Robert. &ldquo;You are cruel, Ellen. You don't
know how I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn't any other way,&rdquo; said Ellen. Then she
looked up into his face with a brave innocence of confession like a
child. &ldquo;It hurts me, too,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Robert had her in his arms, and was covering her face with kisses.
&ldquo;You darling,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It shall not be long.
Something will happen. We cannot live so. We will let it go so a
little while, but something will turn up. I shall have a more
responsible place and a larger salary, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I will let you?&rdquo; asked Ellen, with a
great blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, whether you will let me or not,&rdquo; cried
Robert; and at that moment he felt inclined to marry the entire
Brewster family rather than give up this girl.</p>

<p>However, as he went home, walking that he might think the better,
he had to confess to himself that the girl was right; that, as
matters were, anything definite was out of the question. He had to
admit that it might be a matter of years.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XL</h3>

<p>When Ellen had been at work in the factory a year, she was running
a machine and working by the piece, and earning on an average
eighteen dollars a week. Of course that was an unusual advance for a
girl, but Ellen was herself unusual. She came to work in those days
with such swiftness and unswerving accuracy that she seemed fairly a
part of the great system of labor itself. While she was at her
machine, her very individuality seemed lost; she became an integral
part of a system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's one of the best hands we ever had,&rdquo; Flynn told
Norman Lloyd one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear that,&rdquo; Lloyd responded, smiling
with that peculiar smile of his which was like a cold flash of
steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curse him, he thinks no more of anybody in this shop than
he does of the machine they work,&rdquo; Flynn thought as he watched
the proprietor walking with his stately descent down the stairs. The
noon whistle was blowing, and the younger Lloyd went leaping down the
stairs and joined his uncle, then the two walked down the street,
away from the factory. The factory at that time of year began to
present, in spite of its crude architecture, quite a charming
appearance, from the luxuriant vines which covered it and were
beginning to get autumnal tints of red and russet. All the front of
Lloyd's was covered with vines, which had grown with amazing
swiftness. Mrs. Lloyd often used to look at them and reflect upon
them with complacency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it would make it pleasanter for the men to
work in the factory, when it looks so pretty and green,&rdquo; she
told her husband one of the hottest days of the preceding summer. As
she spoke she compressed her lips in a way which was becoming
habitual to her. It meant the endurance of a sharp stab of vital
pain. There was a terrible pathos in the poor woman's appearance at
that time. She still kept about. Her malady did not seem to be on the
increase, but it endured. Her form had changed indescribably. She had
not lost flesh, but she had a curious, distorted look, and one on
seeing her had a bewildered feeling, and looked again to be sure that
he had seen aright. Her ghastly pallor she concealed in a manner
which she thought distinctly sinful. She painted and powdered. She
did not dare purchase openly the concoctions which were used for
improving her complexion, but she went to a manicure and invested in
a colored salve for her finger-nails. This, with rather surprising
skill for such a conscience-pricked tyro, she applied to the pale
curves of her cheeks and her blue lips. She took more pains than ever
before with her dress, and it was all to deceive her husband, that he
should not be annoyed. She felt a desperate shame because of her
illness; she felt it to be a direct personal injury to this masculine
power which had been set over her gentle femininity. It was not so
much because she was afraid of losing his affection that she
concealed her affliction from him, as because she felt that the
affliction itself was somehow an act of disloyalty. Her terrible
malady had in a way affected her reasoning powers, so that they had
become distorted by a monstrous growth of suffering, like her body.
She would not give up going about as usual, and was never absent from
church. She drove about with her husband in his smart trap. Twice she
had gone with Robert to consult the New York specialist, taking times
when Norman was away on business. She still would not consent to an
operation, and lately the specialist had been lukewarm in advising
it. He had indeed been doubtful from the first.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd treated Robert with a soft affection which was almost
like that of a mother. One night, when he returned late from a call
on Ellen, she sat up waiting for him. He had not called on Ellen
before for several months, and it was nearly midnight when he
returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Lizzie, are you up?&rdquo; he cried, as he
entered the library door and saw his aunt's figure, clad in shining
black satin, gleaming with jet, in the depths of an easy-chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd looked up at him with an expression of patient
suffering. &ldquo;I couldn't go to sleep if I went to bed,
Robert,&rdquo; she replied, in a hushed voice. She found it a comfort
sometimes to confess her pain to him. Robert went over to her, and
drew her large, crinkled, blond head to his shoulder as if she had
been a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; he whispered, stroking her face
pitifully. &ldquo;Is it very terrible?&rdquo; he asked, with his lips
close to her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Terrible,&rdquo; she whispered back. &ldquo;Oh, Robert, you
do not know; pray God you may never know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to God I could bear it for you, Aunt Lizzie,&rdquo;
Robert said, fervently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush! If you or Norman had to bear anything like this,
I should curse God and die,&rdquo; she answered, and she shut her
mouth hard, and her whole face was indicative of a repressed
shriek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Lizzie, don't you think you ought to go to New York,
that you ought&mdash;&rdquo; Robert began, but she stopped him with
an almost fierce peremptoriness. &ldquo;Robert Lloyd, I have trusted
you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For God's sake, don't forsake me. Don't
say a word to me about that; when I can I will. It means my death,
anyhow. Dr. Evarts thought so; you can't deny it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he thought there was a chance, Aunt Lizzie,&rdquo;
Robert returned, but he said it faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can't cheat me,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Lloyd. &ldquo;I
know.&rdquo;  She had a lapse from pain, and her features began to
assume their natural expression. She looked at him almost smiling,
and as if she turned her back upon her own misery. &ldquo;Where have
you been, Robert?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Robert colored a little, but he answered directly enough. &ldquo;I
have been to make a call on Miss Brewster,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't go there very often,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not very often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's a beautiful girl, as beautiful a girl as I ever laid
eyes on, if she does work in the shop,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd,
&ldquo;and she's a good girl, too; I know she is. She was the
sweetest little thing when she was a child, and she 'ain't altered a
mite!&rdquo;  Then Mrs. Lloyd looked with a sort of wistful curiosity
at Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is all true, what you say, Aunt Lizzie,&rdquo;
replied Robert.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd continued to look at him with that wistful
scrutiny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; she began, then she hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Aunt Lizzie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;ever you wanted to marry that girl, I don't see
any reason why you shouldn't, for my part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert pulled a chair close to his aunt, and sat down beside her,
still holding her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've a good mind to tell you the whole story, Aunt
Lizzie,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would, Robert. You know I think as much of you
as if you were my own son, and I won't tell anybody, not even your
uncle, if you don't want me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it is all in a nutshell,&rdquo; said Robert.
&ldquo;I like her, you know, and I think I have ever since I saw her
in her little white gown at the high-school exhibition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn't she sweet?&rdquo; said his aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she likes me, too, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know what my salary is, and her whole family is in
a measure dependent upon her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn't her father got work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll speak to Norman,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lloyd, quickly.
&ldquo;I know he would do it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even then, Aunt Lizzie, there is the aunt in the
asylum, and the child, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your uncle will pay you more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't altogether that; in fact, it isn't that at all
which is at the bottom of the difficulty. The difficulty is with
Ellen herself. She will never consent to my marrying her, and having
to support her family, while matters are as now. You don't know how
proud she is, Aunt Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a splendid girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as I am concerned I would marry the whole lot on a
little more than I have now, but she would not let me do it. There's
nothing to do but to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the aunt will get well and her husband will come
back; and I will see, anyway, if Norman won't give her father
work,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had better not, Aunt Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, Robert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are reasons why I think you had better not.&rdquo;
Robert would not tell her that Ellen had begged him not to use any
influence of his to get her father work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the way father has been turned off, I can't stand
it,&rdquo; she had said, with a sort of angry dignity which was
unusual to her. In fact, her father himself had begged her not to
make use of Robert in any way for his own advancement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they don't want me for my work, I don't want to crawl in
because the nephew of the boss likes my daughter,&rdquo; he had said.
This speech was fairly rough for him, but Ellen had understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean, father,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd rather work in the road,&rdquo; said Andrew. That
autumn he was getting jobs of clearing up yards of fallen leaves, and
gathering feed-corn and pumpkins, and earning a pittance. Fanny
continued to work on her wrappers. &ldquo;It's a mercy wrappers don't
go out of fashion,&rdquo; she often said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose things that folks can get for nothing ain't so
apt to go out of fashion,&rdquo; Andrew retorted, bitterly. He hated
the wrappers with a deadly hatred. He hated the sight of the limp row
of them on his bedroom wall. Nobody knew how the family pinched and
screwed in those days.</p>

<p>They were using the small fund which they secured from the house
mortgage, Ellen's earnings, and Fanny's and Andrew's, and every cent
had to be counted, but there was something splendid in their loyalty
to poor Eva in the asylum. The thought of deserting her in her
extremity never occurred to them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd spoke of her that night, when she and Robert were
talking together in the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are good folks, to keep on doing for that poor woman
in the asylum,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would never desert a dog that belonged to them,&rdquo;
Robert answered, fervently. &ldquo;I tell you that trait is worth a
good many others, Aunt Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it is,&rdquo; said his aunt. Then another paroxysm
of pain seized her. She looked at Robert with a convulsed, speechless
face. He held her hands more tightly, his own face contracting in
sympathy, and watched his aunt with a sort of angry helplessness. But
he felt as if he wanted to fight something for the sake of this poor,
oppressed, innocent creature; indeed, he felt fairly blasphemous. But
this time the pain passed quickly, and Mrs. Lloyd looked at her
nephew with an expression of relief and gentleness which was almost
angelic. When the pain was over she thought again of the Brewsters,
and how they would not have forsaken her in her misery, had she
belonged to them, any more than they had forsaken the insane
aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are good folks,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and that is
the main thing. That is the main thing to consider when you are
marrying into a family, Robert. It is more than riches and position.
The power they've got of loving and standing by each other is worth
more than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Aunt Lizzie, I guess there's no doubt of
that,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that girl's beautiful,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd. She
gazed at the young man with a delicate understanding and sympathy
which was almost beyond that of a sweetheart. Robert felt as if a
soft hand of tenderness and blessing were laid on his inmost heart.
He looked at her like a grateful child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn't anybody like her, is there, Aunt Lizzie?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't think there is, dear boy,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Lloyd. &ldquo;I do think she is the sweetest little thing I ever saw
in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert brought his aunt's hand to his lips and kissed it. It
seemed to him for a minute as if the love and sympathy of this martyr
were almost more precious than the love of Ellen herself.</p>

<p>He realized when he was in his own room, and the house was quiet,
how much he loved his aunt, and how hard her pain and probably
inevitable doom were for him to bear. Then something came to him
which he had never felt before&mdash;a great, burning anxiety and
tenderness and terror over Ellen, because she was of the weaker half
of creation, which is born to the larger share of pain in the world.
He felt that he would almost have given her up, yielded up forever
all his delight in her, to spare her; for the pain of knighthood,
which is in every true lover, awoke in his heart.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLI</h3>

<p>Nahum Beals was a laster in Lloyd's. Late in the autumn, when
Ellen had been in the factory a little over a year, there began to be
a subtle condition of discontent and insubordination. Men gathered in
muttering groups, of which Nahum Beals seemed always to be the
nucleus. His high, rampant voice, restrained by no fear of
consequences, always served as the key-note to the chorus of
rebellion. Ellen paid little attention to it. She was earning good
wages, and personally she had nothing of which to complain. She had
come to regard Beals as something of a chronic fanatic, but as she
knew that the lasters were fairly paid, she had not supposed it meant
anything. However, one night, going home from the factory, her eyes
were opened. Abby and Maria Atkins and Mamie Brady were with her, and
shortly after they had left the shop Abby stopped Granville Joy,
Frank Dixon, and Willy Jones, who with another young man were
swinging past without noticing the girls, strange to say. Abby caught
Joy by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute, Granville Joy,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
want to know what's up with the lasters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granville laughed, with an uneasy, sidelong, deprecating glance at
Ellen. &ldquo;Oh, nothing much,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Willy Jones stood still, coloring, gazing at Abby with a
half-terrified expression. Dixon walked on, and the other young man,
Amos Lee, who was dark and slight and sinewy, stared from one to the
other with quick flashes of black eyes. He looked almost as if he had
gypsy blood in him, and he came of a family which was further on the
outskirts of society than the Louds had been.</p>

<p>When Granville replied &ldquo;nothing much&rdquo; to Abby's
question, Amos Lee frowned with a swift contraction of dissent, but
did not speak until Abby had retorted. &ldquo;You needn't talk that
way to me, Granville Joy,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You can't cheat me.
I know something's up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't nothin', Abby,&rdquo; said Granville, but it was
quite evident that he was lying.</p>

<p>Then Lee spoke up, in a sudden fury of enthusiasm. &ldquo;There is
somethin' up,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I don't care if you do know
it. There's&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped as Granville clutched his arm
violently and whispered something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you're right,&rdquo; said Lee to Joy.
&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he continued to Abby, &ldquo;you and Ellen
come along here a little ways, and I'll tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Maria and Mamie had passed on, Joy and Jones and Lee,
standing close to the two girls, began to talk, Lee leading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look here,&rdquo; he said, in a hushed voice.
&ldquo;We've found out&mdash;no matter how, but we've found
out&mdash;that the boss is goin' to dock the lasters' pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen per cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain't going to stand it,&rdquo; said Lee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see how we can stand it,&rdquo; said Willy Jones,
with a slightly interrogative tone directed towards Abby. Granville
looked at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly sure,&rdquo; replied Granville. &ldquo;What do
you think about it, Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Ellen,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike for fifteen per cent. more before he has a chance to
dock us,&rdquo; cried Lee, with a hushed vehemence, looking about
warily to make sure that no one overheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is, I know it all comes from Nahum Beals,
and he's half cracked,&rdquo; said Abby, bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's got the right of it, anyhow,&rdquo; said Lee.</p>

<p>The two girls walked on, while the men lingered behind to
talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it is true, Abby?&rdquo; asked Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know. I should, if it wasn't for that Lee fellow. I
can't bear him. And that Nahum Beals, I believe he's half
mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel the same way about him,&rdquo; said Ellen;
&ldquo;but think what it would mean, fifteen per cent. less on their
wages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't mean so much for those young fellows, except
Willy Jones; he's got enough on his shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but ever so many of the lasters have large
families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they don't drag Willy Jones into it,&rdquo; said
Abby. She looked back as she spoke. Willy, in the little knot of men,
was looking after her, and their eyes met. Abby colored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a shame to dock his wages,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose&mdash;Willy Jones's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I hope he won't get into any trouble. I can't bear
that Lee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, to dock their wages fifteen per cent.,&rdquo; said
Ellen, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right has Mr. Lloyd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he'd say he has the right because he has the
capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see why that gives him the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better go and talk to him,&rdquo; said Abby.
&ldquo;As for me, I made up my mind when I went to work in the shop
that I'd got to be a bond-slave, all but my soul. That can kick free,
thank the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't make up my mind to it,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;I
am not going to be a slave in any way, and I am not going to approve
of others being slaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think they ought to strike?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if it is true that Mr. Lloyd is going to dock their
wages, but I don't feel sure that it is true. Mr. Beals is a queer
man. Sometimes I have thought he was dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLII</h3>

<p>Tuesday evening was one of those marvellously clear atmospheres of
autumn which seem to be clearer from the contrast to the mists of the
recent summer. The stars swarmed out in unnumbered hosts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I never saw so many stars,&rdquo; one would say
to another. The air had the sharp cleave of the frost in it.
Everything was glittering with a white rime&mdash;the house roofs,
and the levels of fields on the outskirts of the little city.</p>

<p>Ellen had an errand down-town that evening, and she wrapped
herself up warmly, putting on a fur collar which she had not worn
since the winter before. She felt strangely nervous and disturbed as
she set out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you want your father to go with you?&rdquo; asked
Fanny, for in some occult fashion the girl's perturbation seemed to
be communicated to her. She followed her to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems kind of lonesome for you to go alone,&rdquo; she
said, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I minded! Why, it is as bright as day with the
electric-lights, and there are houses almost all the way,&rdquo;
laughed Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father could go with you, or he could go for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he couldn't go for me. I want to get one of the new
catalogues at the library and pick out a book, and there is no sense
in dragging father out. He has a cold, too. Why, there is nothing in
the world to be afraid of, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don't be any longer than you can help,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>Ellen, as she passed her grandmother's house, saw a curtain drawn
with a quick motion. That happened nearly every time she passed. She
knew that the old woman was always on the lookout for her, and always
bent on concealing it. Mrs. Zelotes never went into her son's house,
and never spoke to Ellen in those days. She had aged rapidly during
the past year, and even her erect carriage had failed her. She
stooped rigidly when she walked. She was fairly racked with love and
hatred of Ellen. She adored her, she could have kissed the ground she
walked on, and yet she was so full of wrath against her for thwarting
her hopes for her own advancement that she was conscious of cruel
impulses in her direction.</p>

<p>Ellen walked along rapidly under the vast canopy of stars, about
which she presently began to have a singular impression. She felt as
if they were being augmented, swelled as if by constantly oncoming
legions of light from the space beyond space, and as if her little
space of individuality, her tiny foothold of creation, was being
constantly narrowed by them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw so many stars,&rdquo; she said to herself. She
looked with wonder at the Milky Way, which was like a zone of diamond
dust. Suddenly a mighty conviction of God, which was like the blazing
forth of a new star, was in her soul. Ellen was not in a sense
religious, and had never united with the Congregational Church, which
she had always attended with her parents; she had never been
responsive to efforts made towards her so-called conversion, but all
at once, under the stars that night, she told herself with an
absolute certainty of the truth of it. &ldquo;There is something
beyond everything, beyond the stars, and beyond all poor men, and
beyond me, which is enough for all needs. We shall have our portion
in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had been feeling discouraged lately, although she would not
own it even to herself. She saw Robert but seldom, and her aunt was
no better. She often wondered if there could be anything before her
but that one track of drudgery for daily bread upon which she had set
out. She wondered if she ought not to say positively to Robert that
there must be no thought of anything between them in the future. She
wondered if she were not wronging him. Once or twice she had seen him
riding with Miss Hemingway, and thought that, after all, that was a
girl better suited to him, and perhaps if he had no hope whatever of
her he might turn to the other to his own advantage. But to-night,
with the clear stimulus of the frost in her lungs, and her eyes and
soul dazzled with the multiplicity of stars, she began to have a
great impetus of courage, like a soldier on the morning of battle.
She felt as if she could fight for her joy and the joy of others, and
victory would in the end be certain; that the chances of victory ran
to infinity, and could not be measured.</p>

<p>However, all the while, in spite of her stimulation of spirits,
there was that vague sense of excitement, as over some impending
crisis. That she could not throw off. Suddenly she found herself
searching the road ahead of her, and often turning at the fancied
sound of a footstep. She began to wish that her father had come with
her; then she told herself how foolish she was, for he had a cold,
and this keen air would have been sure to give him more. The
electric-car passed her, and she had a grateful sense of
companionship. She looked after its diminishing light in the
distance, and almost wished that she had stopped it, but car-fares
had to be counted carefully.</p>

<p>She began to dread unspeakably passing the factories. She told
herself that there was no sense in it, that it was not late, that the
electric-light made it like high noon, that there was a watchman in
each building, that there was nothing whatever to fear; but it was in
vain. It was only by a great effort of her will that she did not turn
and go back home when she reached Lloyd's.</p>

<p>Lloyd's came first; then, a few rods farther, on the other side of
the street, McGuire's, and then Briggs's.</p>

<p>Ellen had a library book under her arm, and she clutched her
dress-skirt firmly. A terror as to the supernatural was stealing over
her. She felt as she had when waking in the night from some dreadful
dream, though all the time she was dinning in her ears how foolish
she was. She saw the lantern of the night-watchman in Lloyd's moving
down a stair which crossed a window.</p>

<p>She came opposite Lloyd's, and, just as she did so, saw a dark
figure descending the right-hand flight of stairs from the entrance
platform. She thought, from something in the carriage, that it was
Mr. Lloyd, and hung back a little, reflecting that she would keep
behind him all the way to town.</p>

<p>The man reached the ground at the foot of the stairs, then there
was a flash of fire from the shadow underneath, and a shot rang out.
Ellen did what she could never have counted upon herself for doing.
She ran straight towards the man, who had fallen prostrate like a
log, and was down on the ground beside him, with his head on her lap,
shouting for the night-watchman, whose name was McLaughlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;McLaughlin!&rdquo; she shouted. But there was no need of
it, for he had heard the shot. The cry had not left Ellen's lips
before she was surrounded by men, one of whom was Granville Joy, one
was Dixon, and one was John Sargent.</p>

<p>Joy and Sargent had met down-town, and were walking home together,
when the shot rang out, and they had rushed forward. Then there was
McLaughlin, the watchman of Lloyd's, and the two watchmen from
Briggs's and McGuire's came pelting down their stairs, swinging their
lanterns.</p>

<p>They all stood around the wounded man and Ellen, and stared for a
second. They were half stupefied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God! this is a bad job,&rdquo; said Dixon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go for a doctor,&rdquo; cried Ellen, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We're a pack of fools,&rdquo; ejaculated Sargent, suddenly.
Then he gave Granville Joy a push on the back. &ldquo;Run for your
life for the first doctor,&rdquo; he cried, and was down on his knees
beside the wounded man. Lloyd seemed to be quite insensible. There
was a dark spot which was constantly widening in a hideous circle of
death on his shirt-front when Sargent opened his coat and vest
tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;&rdquo; whispered Ellen. She held one of
Lloyd's hands in a firm clutch as if she would in such wise hold him
to life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; whispered Sargent. Dixon knelt down on
the other side, and took Lloyd's other hand and felt his pulse.
McLaughlin was rushing aimlessly up and down, talking as he went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard a thing till that shot came,&rdquo; he kept
repeating. &ldquo;He'd jest been in to get his pocketbook he'd left
in the office. I never heard a thing till I heard that
shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sargent was opening Lloyd's shirt. &ldquo;McLaughlin, for God's
sake stop talking and run for another doctor, in case Joy does not
get one at once,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;then go to his house, and
tell young Lloyd, but don't say anything to his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Mrs. Lloyd,&rdquo; whispered Ellen.</p>

<p>The sick man sighed audibly. It seemed as if he had heard. The
other watchmen stood looking on helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why in thunder don't you two scatter, and see if you can't
catch him,&rdquo; cried Dixon to them. &ldquo;He can't be far
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the words had no sooner left his mouth than up came a great
Swede who was one of the workmen in Lloyd's, and he had Nahum Beals
in a grasp as imperturbable as fate. The assassin, even with the
strength of his fury of fanaticism, was as a reed in the grasp of
this Northern giant. The Swede held him easily, walking him before
him in a forced march. He had a hand of Nahum's in each of his, and
he compelled Nahum's right hand to retain the hold of the discharged
pistol. There was something terrible about the Swede as he drew near,
a captor as unyielding and pitiless as justice itself. He was even
smiling with a smile which showed his gums from ear to ear, but there
was no joy in his smile, and no triumph. His blue eyes surveyed them
all with the placid content of achievement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I heard him shoot, and I
heard him run, and I stood still until he ran into my arms. I have
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nahum, in the grasp of this fate, was quivering from head to foot,
but not from fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; he shouted, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush up, you murderer,&rdquo; cried Dixon. &ldquo;We didn't
want any such work as this, damn you. Keep fast hold of him,
Olfsen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will keep him fast,&rdquo; replied the Swede,
smiling.</p>

<p>Then there was a swift clatter of wheels, and two doctors drove
up, and men came running. The space in front of Lloyd's was black
with men. Robert Lloyd was among them. Granville Joy had met him on
the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better go down to the factory, quick,&rdquo; he had
said, hoarsely. &ldquo;There's trouble there; your
uncle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert pushed through the crowd, which made way respectfully for
him. He knelt down beside the wounded man. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;&rdquo;
he whispered to Sargent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; whispered Sargent, &ldquo;but I'm afraid
it's pretty bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You here?&rdquo; Robert said to Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I was passing when I heard
the shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;I don't know but I am
asking a good deal, but will you get into Dr. James's buggy, and let
his man drive you to my aunt's, and you break it to her? She likes
you. I must stay with him. I don't want her to know it first when he
is brought home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will be the best way,&rdquo; said the other
physician, who was the one regularly employed by the Lloyds.
&ldquo;Some one must tell her first, and if she knows this young
lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Dr. Story whispered something to Ellen as she was getting into the
buggy. Then Dr. James's man drove her away down the street.</p>

<p>There was a little black mare harnessed to the buggy, and she went
with nervous leaps of speed. When Ellen reached the Lloyd house she
saw that it was blazing with light. Norman Lloyd was fond of
brilliant light, and would have every room in his house illuminated
from garret to cellar.</p>

<p>As Ellen went up the stone steps she saw a woman's figure in the
room at the right, which moved to an attitude of attention when she
rang the bell.</p>

<p>Before Ellen could inquire for Mrs. Lloyd of the maid who answered
her ring there was a shrill cry from the room on the right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it? Who is it?&rdquo; demanded the voice.</p>

<p>Then, before Ellen could speak, Mrs. Lloyd came running out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me quick. I know
something has happened. Tell me quick. You came in Dr. James's buggy,
and the man was driving fast. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Lloyd,&rdquo; said Ellen. Then she could say no
more, but the other woman knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; she asked, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, not dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded, trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who shot him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the workmen. They have him. Carl Olfsen found
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the workmen, when he has always been so
good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Lloyd seemed to gather herself together into the
strength of action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they bringing him home?&rdquo; she asked Ellen, in a
sharp, decisive voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they must be by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I've got to get ready for him. Come, quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was by that time a man and two women servants standing near
them, aghast. Mrs. Lloyd turned to the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go down to the drug-store and get some brandy, there isn't
any in the house,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;then come back as quick as
you can. Maggie, you see that there is plenty of hot water. Martha,
you and Ellen come up-stairs with me, quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen followed Mrs. Lloyd and the maid up-stairs, and, before she
knew what she was doing, was assisting to put the room in perfect
readiness for the wounded man. The maid was weeping all the time she
worked, although she had never liked Mr. Lloyd. There was something
about her mistress which was fairly abnormal. She kept looking at
her. This gentle, soft-natured woman had risen above her own pain and
grief to a sublime strength of misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get the camphor, quick, Martha,&rdquo; she said to the
maid, who flew out, with the tears streaming. Ellen stood on one side
of the bed, and Mrs. Lloyd on the other. Mrs. Lloyd had stripped off
the blankets, and was pinning the sheet tightly over the mattress.
She seemed to know instinctively what to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would bring that basin over here, and put it on
the stand,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd. &ldquo;Martha, you fetch more
towels, and, Maggie, you run up garret and bring down some of those
old sheets from the trunk under the window, quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This maid, who was as large and as ample as her mistress, fled out
of the room with heavy, noiseless pads of flat feet.</p>

<p>All the time Mrs. Lloyd worked she was evidently listening. She
paid no attention to Ellen except to direct her. All at once she gave
a great leap and stood still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're coming,&rdquo; said she, though Ellen had heard
nothing. Ellen went close to her, and took her two fat, cold hands.
She could say nothing. Then she heard the roll of carriage-wheels in
the street below.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd pulled her hands away from Ellen's and went to the head
of the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him right up here,&rdquo; she ordered, in a loud
voice.</p>

<p>Ellen stood back, and the struggling procession with the prostrate
man in the midst labored up the broad stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him in here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd, &ldquo;and lay
him on the bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Lloyd was stretched on the bed, the crowd drew back a little,
and she bent over him.</p>

<p>Then she turned with a sort of fierceness to the doctors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you do something?&rdquo; she demanded. She raised
a hand with a repellant gesture towards the other men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better go now,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I thank you
very much. If there is anything you can do, I will let you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Mrs. Lloyd was left with the two doctors and a young
assistant, Robert, and Ellen, she said, cutting her words short as if
she released every one from a mental grip:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have got everything ready. Shall I go out now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had better, Mrs. Lloyd,&rdquo; said the family
physician, pityingly. He went close to Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't you stay with her a little while?&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>

<p>Ellen nodded.</p>

<p>Then the physician spoke quite loudly and cheerfully to Mrs.
Lloyd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to probe for the ball,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We must all hope for the best, Mrs. Lloyd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd made no reply. She bent again over her husband with a
rigid face, and kissed him on his white lips, then she went out, with
Ellen following.</p>

<p>Norman Lloyd lived only two hours after he was shot. The efforts
to remove the ball had to be abandoned. He was conscious only a few
minutes. He suddenly began to look about him with comprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; he said, in a far-away voice.</p>

<p>Robert stooped closely over his uncle. The dying man looked up at
him with an expression which he had never worn in life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man was insane,&rdquo; whispered he, faintly. Then he
added, &ldquo;Look out for her, if she has to go through the
operation. Take care of her. Make it as easy for her as you
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you know, Uncle Norman,&rdquo; gasped Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the time, but it&mdash;pleased her to think I&mdash;did
not. Don't let her know I knew. Take care&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Norman Lloyd relapsed into unconsciousness, and the whole
room and the whole house became clamorous with his stertorous
breathing. Mrs. Lloyd and Ellen came and stood in the doorway. The
doctor whispered to them. Then the breathing ceased, although at
first it was inconceivable that the silence did not continue to ring
with it, and Mrs. Lloyd came into the room.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLIII</h3>

<p>When Mrs. Lloyd entered the room, the attention of every one was
taken from the dead man on the bed and concentrated upon the woman.
Dr. Story, a nervous, intense, elderly man with a settled frown of
perplexity over keen eyes, which he had gotten from a struggle of
forty years with unanswerable problems of life and death, stepped
towards her hastily. Robert pressed close to her side. Ellen came
behind her, holding in a curious, instinctive fashion to a fold of
the older woman's gown, as if she had been a mother holding back a
child from a sudden topple to its hurt. Everybody expected her to
make some heart-breaking manifestation. She did nothing. At that
moment the sublime unselfishness of the woman, which was her one
strength of character, seemed actually to spread itself, as with
wings, before them all. She moved steadily, close to her husband on
the bed. She gazed at that profile of rigid calmness and enforced
peace, which, although the head lay low, seemed to have an effect of
upward motion, as if it were cleaving the mystery of space. Mrs.
Lloyd laid her hand upon her husband's forehead; she felt a slight
incredulousness of death, because it was still warm. She took his
hands, drew them softly together, and folded them upon his breast.
Then she turned and faced them all with an angelic expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not realize it to suffer much?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Lloyd,&rdquo; replied Dr. Story, quickly.
&ldquo;No, I assure you that he suffered very little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seemed very happy when he died, Aunt Lizzie,&rdquo; said
Robert, huskily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd looked away from them all around the room. It was a
magnificent apartment. Norman Lloyd had had an artistic taste as well
as wealth. The furnishings had always been rather beyond Mrs. Lloyd's
appreciation, but she admired them kindly. She took in every detail;
the foam of rich curtains at the great windows, the cut-glass and
silver on the dressing-table, the pale softness of a polar-bear skin
beside the bed, the lifelike insistence of the costly pictures on the
walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's gone where it is a great deal more beautiful,&rdquo;
she said to them, like a child. &ldquo;He's gone where there's better
treasures than these which he had here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all looked at her in amazement. It actually seemed as if, for
the moment, the woman's sole grief was over the loss to her husband
of those things which he had on earth&mdash;the treasures of his
mortal state.</p>

<p>Robert took hold of his aunt's arm and led her, quite unresisting,
from the room, and as she went she felt for Ellen's hand. &ldquo;It
is time she was home,&rdquo; she said to Robert. &ldquo;Her folks
will be worried about her. She's been a real comfort to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first time that Ellen had ever seen death, that she had
ever seen the living confronted with it. She felt as if a wave were
breaking over her own head as she clung fast to Mrs. Lloyd's
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sha'n't I stay?&rdquo; she whispered, pitifully, to her.
&ldquo;If I can send word to my mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you dear child,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Lloyd,
&ldquo;you've done enough, and you will have to be up early in the
morning.&rdquo;  Then she checked herself. &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo;
said she to Robert; &ldquo;the factory will be closed till after the
funeral, won't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it will, Aunt Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the workmen will be paid just the same, of
course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd. &ldquo;Now, can't you take her home,
Robert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't mind about me,&rdquo; cried Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can have a horse put into the buggy,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Lloyd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn't leave her now,&rdquo; Ellen whispered to
Robert. &ldquo;Let somebody else take me&mdash;Dr.
James&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather you took her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lloyd.
&ldquo;And you needn't worry about his leaving me, dear child; the
doctor will stay until he comes back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Robert was finally going out his aunt caught his arm and looked
at him with a radiant expression. &ldquo;He will never know about
<em>me</em> now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and it won't be long before
I&mdash; Oh, I feel as if I had gotten rid of my own
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was filled with inexpressible thankfulness that she had
herself to bear what she had dreaded for her husband. &ldquo;Only
think how hard it would have been for Norman,&rdquo; she said to
Cynthia, the next day.</p>

<p>Cynthia looked at her wonderingly. She could have understood this
feeling over a dearly beloved child. &ldquo;You are a good woman,
Lizzie,&rdquo; she said, in a tone of pitiful respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not half as good a woman as he was a man,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Lloyd, jealously. &ldquo;Norman wasn't a professor, I know, but
he was a believer. You don't think it is necessary to be a professor
in order to be saved, do you, Cynthia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly do not,&rdquo; Cynthia replied. &ldquo;I wish
you would go and lie down, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can't. I wouldn't let anybody do these things but me,
for the whole world.&rdquo;  Mrs. Lloyd was arranging flowers,
tuberoses and white carnations, in vases, and the whole house was
scented with them. She looked ghastly, yet still unconquerably happy.
She had now no reason to conceal the ravages of disease, and her
color was something frightful. Still, she did not suffer as much, for
her mind had overborne her body to such an extent that she had the
mastery for the time, to a certain extent, of those excruciating
stabs of pain. People looked at her incredulously. They could not
believe that she felt as she talked, that she was as happy and
resigned as she looked, but it was all true. It was either an
abnormal state into which her husband's death had thrown her, or one
too normal to be credited. She looked at it all with a supreme
childishness and simplicity. She simply believed that her husband was
in heaven, where she should join him; that he was beyond all
suffering which might have come to him through her, and all that
troubled her was the one consideration of his having been forced to
leave his treasures of earth. She looked at various things which had
been prized by the dead man, and found her chief comfort in saying to
the minister or Cynthia or Robert that Norman had loved these, but he
would have that which was infinitely more precious. She even gazed
out of the window, that Tuesday night, and saw her nephew driving
away with Ellen, and reflected, with pain, that her husband had been
fond and proud of that bay. She was a little at a loss to conceive
what could make up to her husband for that in another world, but she
succeeded, and evolved from her own loving fancy, and her
recollection of the Old Testament, a conception of some wonderful
creature, shod with thunder and maned with a whirlwind. Her disease,
and a drug she had been taking of late, stimulated her imagination to
results of grotesque pathos, but she was comforted.</p>

<p>That night when they were alone, Robert turned to the girl at his
side with a sudden motion. It was no time for love-making, for that
was in the mind of neither of them, but the bereavement of this other
woman, and the tragedy of her state, filled him with a sort of
protective pain towards the girl who might some time have to suffer
through him the same loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all tired out, dear?&rdquo; he said, and passed his
free arm around her waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ellen. Then, since she was only a girl,
and overwrought, having been through a severe strain, she broke down,
and began to cry.</p>

<p>Robert drew her closer, and she hid her face on his shoulder.
&ldquo;Poor little girl, it has been very hard for you,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't think of me,&rdquo; sobbed Ellen. &ldquo;But I
can't bear it, the way she acts and looks. It is sadder than
grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not going to live long herself, dear,&rdquo; said
Robert, in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&mdash;did not know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! yes; but you must never tell any one. She tried to
keep it from him. That is her comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Ellen. She looked up at the white face of
the young man bending over her, and suddenly the realization of a
love that was mightier than all the creatures who came of it and all
who followed it was over her.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLIV</h3>

<p>When Ellen did not return, there was some alarm in the Brewster
household. Mrs. Zelotes came over, finally, in a quiver of
anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I had better start out and see if I can find
her,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had better,&rdquo; returned his mother.
&ldquo;She went before eight o'clock, and it's most midnight, and
I've set at my window watchin' ever since. I don't see what you've
been thinkin' about, waitin' all this time. I guess if I was a man I
shouldn't have waited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she may have gone in to see Abby Atkins&mdash;it's
on the way&mdash;and not realized how late it was,&rdquo; said Fanny,
obstinately, but with a very white face. She drew her thread through
with a jerk. It knotted, and she broke it off viciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's no use imaginin' things,&rdquo; said Fanny,
angrily; &ldquo;but I think myself you'd better go now, Andrew, and
see if you can see anything of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm goin' with him,&rdquo; announced Mrs. Zelotes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, mother, you'd better stay where you be,&rdquo; said
Andrew, putting on his hat. Then the door flew open, and Amos Lee,
who had seen the light in the windows, and was burning to impart the
news of the tragedy, rushed in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard what's happened?&rdquo; he cried out.</p>

<p>They all thought of Ellen. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Andrew, in
a terrible voice. Fanny dropped her work and stared at him, with her
chin falling as if she were dying. Mrs. Zelotes made a queer gurgling
noise in her throat. Lee stared at them a second, bewildered by the
effect of his own words, although they had for him such a tragic
import. Andrew caught hold of him in a grasp like the clamp of a
machine. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he demanded again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boss has been shot,&rdquo; cried Lee, getting his
breath.</p>

<p>Andrew dropped his arm, and they all stared at him. Lee went on
fluently, as if he were a fakir at a fair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nahum Beals did it. The boss went back to the office to get
his pocketbook; McLaughlin saw him; then he went down the stairs;
Nahum, he&mdash;he fired; he had been hidin' underneath the stairs.
Carl Olfsen caught him, and he's in jail. Your daughter she was there
when the shot came, and run up and held his head. The young boss he
sent her in Dr. James's buggy to Mrs. Lloyd to break the news. She
'ain't got home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; gasped Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boss has been shot; he's dead by this time,&rdquo;
repeated Lee. &ldquo;Beals did it; they've got him.&rdquo;  There was
the most singular evenness and impartiality in his tone, although he
was evidently strained to a high pitch of excitement. It was
impossible to tell whether he exulted in or was aghast at the
tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that poor woman!&rdquo; cried Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd like to know what they'll do next,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Zelotes. &ldquo;I should call it pretty work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nahum Beals has acted to me as if he was half crazy for
some time,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it,&rdquo; said Lee; &ldquo;but I shouldn't
wonder if he had to swing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's dreadful,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I wonder when
she's comin' home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems as if they might have got somebody besides that girl
to have gone there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Zelotes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She happened to be right on the spot,&rdquo; said Lee,
importantly.</p>

<p>Andrew seemed speechless; he leaned against the mantel-shelf,
gazing from one to the other, breathing hard. He had had bitter
feelings against the murdered man, and a curious sense of guilt was
over him. He felt almost as if he were the murderer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew, I dun'no' but you'd better go up there and see if
she's comin' home,&rdquo; said Fanny; and he answered heavily that
maybe he had better, when they heard wheels, which stopped before the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're bringin' her home,&rdquo; said Lee.</p>

<p>Andrew ran and threw open the front door. He had a glimpse of
Robert's pale face, nodding to him from the buggy as he drove away,
and Ellen came hastening up the walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ellen, this is pretty dreadful news,&rdquo; said her
father, tremulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amos Lee has just come in. It's a terrible thing,
Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it's terrible,&rdquo; returned Ellen, in a quick,
strained voice. She entered the sitting-room, and when she met her
mother's anxious, tender eyes, she stood back against the wall, with
her hands to her face, sobbing. Fanny ran to her, but her grandmother
was quicker. She had her arms around the girl before the mother had a
chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they couldn't get somebody besides you,&rdquo; she said,
in a voice of intensest love and anger, &ldquo;I should call it
pretty work. Now you go straight to bed, Ellen Brewster, and I'm
goin' to make a bowl of sage tea, and bring it up, and see if it
won't quiet your nerves. I call it pretty work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you'd better go to bed, Ellen,&rdquo; said Andrew,
gulping as if he were swallowing a sob.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes fairly forced Ellen towards the door, Fanny
following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't talk and wake Amabel,&rdquo; whispered Ellen, forcing
back her sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he dead when you got there, Ellen?&rdquo; called out
Lee.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes turned back and looked at him. &ldquo;It's after
midnight, and time for you to be goin' home,&rdquo; she said. Then
the three disappeared. Lee grinned sheepishly at Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother is a stepper of an old woman,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's awful news,&rdquo; said Andrew, soberly.
&ldquo;Whatever anybody may have felt, nobody
expected&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they didn't,&rdquo; retorted Lee, quickly.
&ldquo;Nahum went a step too far.&rdquo;  He started for the door as
he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he was crazy, without any doubt!&rdquo; said
Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll have to swing for it all the same,&rdquo; said Lee,
going out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don't seem right, if he wasn't himself when he did
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, we're all crazy when it comes to things like
that,&rdquo; returned Lee. Before closing the door he flashed his
black eyes and white teeth at Andrew, who felt repelled.</p>

<p>He sat down beside the table and leaned his head upon it. To his
fancy all creation seemed to circle about that one dead man. Mr.
Lloyd had been for years the arbiter of his destiny, almost of his
life. Andrew had regarded him with almost feudal loyalty and
admiration, and lately with bitter revolt and hatred, and now he was
dead. He felt no sorrow, but rather a terrible remorse because he
felt no sorrow. All the bitter thoughts which he had ever had against
Lloyd seemed to marshal themselves before him like an accusing legion
of ghosts. And with it all there was a sense of desolation, as if
some force which had been necessary to his full living had gone out
of creation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's over thirty years since I went to work under
him,&rdquo; Andrew thought, and he gave a dry sob. At that moment a
wonderful pity and sorrow for the dead man seemed to spring up in his
soul like a light. He felt as if he loved him.</p>

<p><br>Norman Lloyd's funeral was held in the First Baptist Church of
Rowe. It was crowded. Mr. Lloyd had been the most prominent
manufacturer and the wealthiest man in the city. His employ&eacute;s
filled up a great space in the body of the church.</p>

<p>Andrew went with his mother and wife. They arrived quite early.
When Andrew saw the employ&eacute;s of Lloyd's marching in, he drew a
great sigh. He looked at the solemn black thing raised on trestles
before the pulpit with an emotion which he could not himself
understand. &ldquo;That man 'ain't treated me well enough for me to
care anything about him,&rdquo; he kept urging upon himself.
&ldquo;He never paid any more attention to me than a gravel-stone
under his feet; there ain't any reason why I should have cared about
him, and I don't; it can't be that I do.&rdquo;  Yet arguing with
himself in this way, he continued to eye the casket which held his
dead employer with an unyielding grief.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zelotes sat like a black, draped statue at the head of the
pew, but her eyes behind her black veil were sharply observant. She
missed not one detail. She saw everything; she counted the wreaths
and bouquets on the casket, and stored in her mind, as vividly as she
might have done some old mourning-piece, the picture of the near
relatives advancing up the aisle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd came leaning on her nephew's arm, and there were
Cynthia Lennox and a distant cousin, an elderly widow who had been
summoned to the house of death.</p>

<p>Ellen sat in the body of the church, with the employ&eacute;s of
Lloyd's, between Abby Atkins and Maria. She glanced up when the
little company of mourners entered, then cast her eyes down again and
compressed her lips. Maria began to weep softly, pressing her
handkerchief to her eyes. Ellen's mother had begged her not to sit
with the employ&eacute;s, but with her and her father and grandmother
in their own pew, but the girl had refused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must sit where I belong,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she thinks it would look as if she was putting on
airs on account of&mdash;&rdquo; Fanny said to Andrew when Ellen had
gone out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess she's right,&rdquo; returned Andrew.</p>

<p>The employ&eacute;s had contributed money for a great floral piece
composed of laurel and white roses, in the shape of a pillow. Mamie
Brady, who sat behind Ellen, leaned over, and in a whisper whistled
into her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't it handsome?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Can you see them
flowers from the hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded impatiently. The great green and white decoration was
in plain view from her seat, and as she looked at it she wondered if
it were a sarcasm or poetic truth beyond the scope of the givers, the
pillow of laurel and roses, emblematic of eternal peace, presented by
the hard hands of labor to dead capital.</p>

<p>Of course the tragic circumstances of Norman Lloyd's death
increased the curiosity of the public. Gradually the church became
crowded by a slow and solemn pressure. The aisles were filled. The
air was heavy with the funeral flowers. The minister spoke at length,
descanting upon the character of the deceased, his uprightness and
strict integrity in business, avoiding pitfalls of admissions of
weaknesses with the expertness of a juggler. He was always regarded
as very apt at funerals, never saying too much and never too little.
The church was very still, the whole audience wrapped in a solemn
hush, until the minister began to pray; then there was a general
bending of heads and devout screening of faces with hands. Then all
at once a sob from a woman sounded from the rear of the church. It
was hysterical, and had burst from the restraint of the weeper.
People turned about furtively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; whispered Mamie Brady, after a
prolonged stare over her shoulders from under her red frizzle of
hair. &ldquo;It ain't any of the mourners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do keep still, Mamie Brady,&rdquo; whispered Abby
Atkins.</p>

<p>The sob came again, and this time it was echoed from the pew where
sat the members of the dead man's family. Mrs. Lloyd began weeping
convulsively. Her state of mind had raised her above natural emotion,
and yet her nerves weakly yielded to it when given such an impetus.
She wept like a child, and now and then a low murmur of heart-broken
complaint came from her lips, and was heard distinctly over the
church. Other women began to weep. The minister prayed, and his words
of comfort seemed like the air in a discordant medley of sorrow.</p>

<p>Andrew Brewster's face twitched; he held his hands clutched
tightly. Fanny was weeping, but the old woman at the head of the pew
sat immovable.</p>

<p>When the services were over, and the great concourse of people had
passed around the casket and viewed the face of the dead, with keen,
sidewise observation of the funeral flowers, Mrs. Zelotes pressed out
as fast as she was able without seeming to crowd, and caught up with
Mrs. Pointdexter, who had sat in the rear of the church.</p>

<p>She came alongside as they left the church, and the two old women
moved slowly down the sidewalk, with lingering glances at the funeral
procession drawn up in front of the church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was that cryin' so in back; did you see?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Zelotes of Mrs. Pointdexter, whose eyes were red, and whose face
bore an expression of meek endurance of a renewal of her own
experience of sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Joe Martin's wife,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I sat
just behind her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then both started, for the woman who had sobbed came up behind
them, her brother, an elderly man, trying to hold her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stop, John,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I heard what she
said, and I'm goin' to tell her. I'm goin' to tell everybody. Nobody
shall stop me. There the minister spoke and spoke and spoke, and he
never said a word as to any good he'd done. I'm goin' to tell. I
wanted to stan' right up in the church an' tell everybody. He told me
not to say a word about it, an' I never did whilst he was livin', but
now I'm goin' to stan' up for the dead.&rdquo;  The woman pulled
herself loose from her brother, who stood behind her, frightened, and
continually thrusting out a black-gloved hand of remonstrance. People
began to gather. The woman, who was quite old, had a face graven with
hard lines of habitual restraint, which was now, from its utter
abandon, at once pathetic and terrible. She made a motion as if she
were thrusting her own self into the background.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm goin' to speak,&rdquo; she said, in a high voice.
&ldquo;I held my tongue for the livin', but I'm goin' to speak for
the dead. My poor husband died twenty years ago, got his hand cut in
a machine in Lloyd's, and had lockjaw, and I was left with my
daughter that had spinal disease, and my little boy that died, and my
own health none too good, and&mdash;and he&mdash;he&mdash;came to my
house, one night after the funeral, and&mdash;and told me he was
goin' to look out for me, and he has, he has. That blessed man gave
me five dollars every week of my life, and he buried poor Annie when
she died, and my little boy, and he made me promise never to say a
word about it. Five dollars every week of my life&mdash;five
dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman's voice ended in a long-drawn, hysterical wail. The
other women who had been listening began to weep. Mrs. Pointdexter,
when she and Mrs. Zelotes moved on, was sobbing softly, but Mrs.
Zelotes's face, though moved, wore an expression of stern
conjecture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd like to know how many things like that Norman Lloyd
did,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I never supposed he was that kind of a
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had a bewildered feeling, as if she had to reconstruct her own
idea of the dead man as a monument to his memory, and reconstruction
was never an easy task for the old woman.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLV</h3>

<p>A Short time after Norman Lloyd's death, Ellen, when she had
reached the factory one morning, met a stream of returning workmen.
They swung along, and on their faces were expressions of mingled
solemnity and exultation, as of children let out to play because of
sorrow in the house, which will not brook the jarring inconsequence
of youth.</p>

<p>Mamie Brady, walking beside a young man as red-haired as herself,
called out, with ill-repressed glee, &ldquo;Turn round, Ellen
Brewster; there ain't no shop to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man at her side, nervously meagre, looked at Ellen with
a humorous contortion of this thin face, then he caught Mamie Brady
by the arm, and swung her into a hopity-skip down the sidewalk. Just
behind them came Granville Joy, with another man. Ellen stopped.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;Why is the shop
closed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granville stopped, and let the stream of workmen pass him and
Ellen. They stood in the midst of it, separating it, as rock will
separate a current. &ldquo;Mrs. Lloyd is dead,&rdquo; Granville
replied, soberly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard she was very low last night,&rdquo; Ellen returned,
in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>Then she passed Granville, who stood a second gazing wistfully
after her, before he resumed his homeward way. He told himself quite
accurately that she had purposely refrained from turning, in order to
avoid walking with himself. A certain resentment seized him. It
seemed to him that something besides his love had been slighted.
&ldquo;She needn't have thought I was going to make love to her going
home in broad daylight with all these folks,&rdquo; he reflected, and
he threw up his head impatiently.</p>

<p>The man with whom he had been walking when Ellen appeared lingered
for him to rejoin him. &ldquo;Wonder how many shops they'd shut up
for you and me,&rdquo; said the man, with a sort of humorous
bitterness. He had a broad face, seemingly fixed in an eternal mask
of laughter, and yet there were hard lines in it, and a forehead of
relentless judgment overhung his wide bow of mouth and his squat and
wrinkled nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess not many,&rdquo; replied Granville, echoing the man
in a way unusual to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet if it wa'n't for us they couldn't keep the shop
running at all,&rdquo; said the man, whose name was Tom Peel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Granville, with a slight glance over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Ellen had met the Atkins girls, and had turned, and was coming
back with them. It was as he had thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the new boss cuts down fifteen per cent., as the talk
is, what be you goin' to do?&rdquo; asked Tom Peel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't goin' to stand it,&rdquo; replied Granville,
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't goin' to be swept clean by the new broom, hey?&rdquo;
said the man, with a widened grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; thundered Granville&mdash;&ldquo;not by him, nor
any one like him. Damn him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Peel's grin widened still further into an intense but silent
laugh.</p>

<p>Meantime Ellen was walking with Abby and Maria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how we're going to get along with young
Lloyd,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>Ellen looked at her keenly. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I heard the men talking the other night after I'd gone
to bed. Maybe it isn't true that he's thinking of cutting down the
wages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can't be,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say so, too,&rdquo; said Maria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope not,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;You can't tell.
Some chimneys always have the wind whistling in them, and I suppose
it's about so with a boot and shoe shop. It don't follow that there's
going to be a hurricane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had come to the entrance of the street where the Atkins
sisters lived, and Ellen parted from them.</p>

<p>She kept on her way quite alone. They had walked slowly, and the
other operatives had either boarded cars or had gone out of
sight.</p>

<p>Ellen, when she turned, faced the northwest, out of which a stiff
wind was blowing. She thrust a hand up each jacket-sleeve, folding
her arms, but she let the fierce wind smite her full in the face
without blenching. She had a sort of delight in facing a wind like
that, and her quick young blood kept her from being chilled. The
sidewalk was frozen. There was no snow, and the day before there had
been a thaw. One could see on this walk, hardened into temporary
stability, the footprints of hundreds of the sons and daughters of
labor. Read rightly, that sidewalk in the little manufacturing city
was a hieroglyphic of toil, and perhaps of toil as tending to the
advance of the whole world. Ellen did not think of that, for she was
occupied with more personal considerations, thinking of the dead
woman in the great Lloyd house. She pictured her lying dead on that
same bed whereon she had seen her husband lie dead. All the ghastly
concomitants of death came to her mind. &ldquo;They will turn off all
that summer heat, and leave her alone in this freezing cold,&rdquo;
she thought. She remembered the sound of that other woman's kind
voice in her ears, and she saw her face when she told her the
dreadful news of her husband's death. She felt a sob rising in her
throat, but forced it back. What Abby had told concerning Mrs.
Lloyd's happiness in the face of death seemed to her heart-breaking,
though she knew not why. That enormous, almost transcendent trust in
that which was absolutely unknown seemed to engulf her.</p>

<p>When she reached home, her mother looked at her in astonishment.
She was sewing on the interminable wrappers. Andrew was paring apples
for pies. &ldquo;What be you home for&mdash;be you sick?&rdquo; asked
Fanny. Andrew gazed at her in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not sick,&rdquo; replied Ellen, shortly.
&ldquo;Mrs. Lloyd is dead, and the factory's closed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard she was very low&mdash;Mrs. Jones told me so
yesterday,&rdquo; said Fanny, in a hushed voice. Andrew began paring
another apple. He was quite pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is the funeral to be, did you hear?&rdquo; asked
Fanny. Ellen was hanging up her hat and coat in the entry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything about the hands sending
flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they will,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;as long as
they sent one to him. Well, she was a good woman, and it's a mark of
respect, and I 'ain't anything to say against it, but I can't help
feeling as if it was a tax.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLVI</h3>

<p>It was some time after Mrs. Lloyd's death. Ellen had not seen
Robert except as she had caught from time to time a passing glimpse
of him in the factory. One night she overheard her father and mother
talking about him after she had gone to bed, the sitting-room door
having been left ajar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he'd come and call after his aunt died,&rdquo;
she heard Fanny say. &ldquo;I've always thought he liked Ellen, an'
here he is now, with all that big factory, an' plenty of
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he will,&rdquo; replied Andrew, with a voice in which
were conflicting emotions, pride and sadness, and a struggle for
self-renunciation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a splendid thing for her,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a splendid thing for <em>him</em>,&rdquo;
returned Andrew, with a flash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land, of course it would! You needn't be so smart, Andrew
Brewster. I guess I know what Ellen is, as well as you. Any man might
be proud to get her&mdash;I don't care who&mdash;whether he's Robert
Lloyd, or who, but that don't alter what I say. It would be a
splendid chance for Ellen. Only think of that great Lloyd house, and
it must be full of beautiful things&mdash;table linen, and silver,
and what-not. I say it would be a splendid thing for her, and she'd
be above want all her life&mdash;that's something to be considered
when we 'ain't got any more than we have to leave her, and she
workin' the way she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that's so,&rdquo; assented Andrew, with a heavy sigh,
as of one who looks upon life from under the mortification of an
incubus of fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'd ought to think of her best good,&rdquo; said Fanny,
judiciously. &ldquo;I've been thinkin' every evening lately that he'd
be comin'. I've had the fire in the parlor stove all ready to touch
off, an' I've kept dusted in there. I know he liked her, but mebbe
he's like all the rest of the big-bugs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Andrew, with an inward qualm
of repulsion. He always hated unspeakably to hear his wife say
&ldquo;big-bugs&rdquo; in that tone. Although he was far from being
without humility, he was republican to the core in his estimate of
his own status in his own free country. In his heart, as long as he
kept the law of God and man, he recognized no &ldquo;big-bugs.&rdquo;
 It was one of the taints of his wife's ancestry which grated upon
him from time to time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, mebbe he don't want to be seen callin' on a
shop-girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he'd better keep away, that's all!&rdquo; cried
Andrew, furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, mebbe it ain't so,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;He's
always seemed to me like a sensible feller, and I know he's liked
Ellen, an' lots of girls that work in shops marry rich. Look at Annie
Graves, married that factory boss over to Pemberton, an' has
everythin'. She'd worked in his factory years. Mebbe it ain't
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen don't act as if she minded anything about his not
comin',&rdquo; said Andrew, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land, no; she ain't that kind. She's too much like her
grandmother, but there 'ain't been a night lately that she 'ain't
done her hair over when she got home from the shop and changed her
dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She always changes her dress, don't she?&rdquo; said
Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, she always has done that. I guess she likes to get
rid of the leather smell for a while; but she has put on that pretty,
new, red silk waist, and I've seen her watchin', though she's never
said anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't suppose she&mdash;&rdquo; began Andrew, in a
voice of intensest anxiety and indignant tenderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land, no; Ellen Brewster ain't a girl to fret herself much
over any man unless she's sure he wants her; trust her. Don't you
worry about that. All I mean is, I know she's had a kind of an idea
that he might come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen, up-stairs, lay listening against her will, and felt herself
burning with mortified pride and shame. She said to herself that she
would never put on that red silk waist again of an evening; she would
not even do her hair over. It was quite true that she had thought
that Robert might come, that he might renew his offer, now that he
was so differently situated, and the obstacles, on his side, at
least, removed. She told herself all the time that the obstacles on
her own were still far from removed. She asked herself how could she,
even if this man loved her and wished to marry her, allow him to
support all her family, although he might be able to do so. She often
told herself that she ought perhaps to have pride enough to refuse,
and yet she watched for him to come. She had reflected at first that
it was, of course, impossible for him to seem to take advantage of
the deaths which had left him with this independence, that he must
stay away for a while from motives of delicacy; but now the months
were going, and she began to wonder if he never would come. Every
night, when she took off the pretty, red silk waist, donned in vain,
and let down her fair lengths of hair, it was with a sinking of her
heart, and a sense of incredulous unhappiness. Ellen had always had a
sort of sanguinity of happiness and of the petting of Providence as
well as of her friends. However, the girl had, in spite of her
childlike trust in the beauty of her life, plenty of strength to meet
its refutal, and a pride equal to her grandmother's. In case Robert
Lloyd should never approach her again, she would try to keep one face
of her soul always veiled to her inmost consciousness.</p>

<p>The next evening she was careful not to put on her red silk waist,
but changed her shop dress for her old blue woollen, and only
smoothed her hair. She even went to bed early in order to prove to
her mother that she expected nobody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain't goin' to bed as early as this, Ellen?&rdquo; her
mother said, as she lighted her lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I'm going to bed and read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems as if somebody might be in,&rdquo; said Fanny,
awkwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know who,&rdquo; Ellen returned, with a gentle
haughtiness.</p>

<p>Andrew colored. He was at his usual task of paring apples. Andrew,
in lieu of regular work outside, assisted in these household tasks,
that his wife might have more time to sew. He looked unusually worn
and old that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anybody does come, Ellen will have to get up, that's
all,&rdquo; said Fanny, when the girl had gone up-stairs. Then she
pricked up her ears, for the electric-car had stopped before the
house. Then it went on, with a sharp clang of the bell and a
gathering rush of motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That car stopped,&rdquo; Fanny said, breathlessly, her work
falling from her fingers. Andrew and she both listened intently, then
footsteps were heard plainly coming around the path at the side of
the house.</p>

<p>Fanny's face fell. &ldquo;It's only some of the men,&rdquo; said
she, in a low voice. Then there came a knock on the side door, and
Andrew ushered in John Sargent, Joe Atkins, and Amos Lee. Nahum Beals
did not come in those days, for he was in prison awaiting trial for
the murder of Norman Lloyd. However, Amos Lee's note was as
impressive as his. He called often with Sargent and Atkins. They
could not shake him off. He lay in wait for them at street corners,
and joined them. He never saw Ellen alone, and did not openly
proclaim his calls as meant for her. She prevented him from doing
that in a manner which he could not withstand, full of hot and
reckless daring as he was. When he entered that night he looked
around with keen furtiveness, and was evidently listening and
watching for her, though presently his voice rose high in discussion
with the others. After a while the man who lived next door dropped
in, and his wife with him. She and Fanny withdrew to the dining-room
with their sewing&mdash;for the woman also worked on
wrappers&mdash;and left the sitting-room to the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It beats all how they like to talk,&rdquo; said the woman,
with a large-minded leniency, &ldquo;and they never get
anywhere,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;They work themselves all up, and
never get anywhere; but men are all like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they be,&rdquo; assented Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jest hear that Lee feller,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>

<p>Amos Lee's voice was audible over the little house, and could have
been heard in the yard, for it had an enormous carrying quality. It
was the voice of a public ranter. Ellen, up in her chamber, lying in
her bed, with a lamp at her side, reading, closely covered from the
cold&mdash;for the room was unheated&mdash;heard him with a shiver of
disgust and repulsion, and yet with a fierce sympathy and loyalty.
She could not distinguish every word he said, but she knew well what
he was talking about.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lloyd's death had made a certain hush in the ferment of
revolt at Lloyd's, but now it was again on the move. There was a
strong feeling of dislike to young Lloyd among the workmen. His uncle
had heaped up ill-feeling as well as wealth as a heritage for him.
The older Lloyd had never been popular, and Robert had succeeded to
all his unpopularity, and was fast gathering his own. He was
undoubtedly disposed to follow largely his uncle's business methods.
He had admired them, they had proved successful, and he had honestly
seen nothing culpable in them as business methods go; so it was not
strange that he tried to copy them when he came into charge of
Lloyd's. He was inclined to meet opposition with the same cool
inflexibility of persistency in his own views, and was disposed to
consult his own interests and carry out his own plans with no more
brooking of interference than the skipper of a man-o'-war. Therefore,
when it happened, shortly after his aunt's death, that he conceived a
dissatisfaction with some prominent spirits among union men, he
discharged them without the slightest reference to the fact that they
were old and skilful workmen, and employed non-union men from another
town in their places. He had, indeed, the object of making in time
his factory entirely non-union. He said to himself that he would be
dictated to by no labor organization under the sun, and that went a
step beyond his uncle, inasmuch as the elder Lloyd had always made
his own opinion subservient to good business policy; but Robert was
younger and his blood hotter. It happened, also, a month later, when
he began to see that business had fallen off considerably (indeed, it
was the beginning of a period of extreme business depression), and
that he could no longer continue on the same scale with the same
profits, that instead of assembling the men in different departments,
communicating the situation to them, and submitting them a reduced
price-list for consideration, as was the custom with the more pacific
of the manufacturers in the vicinity, he posted it up in the
different rooms with no ado whatever. That had been his uncle's
method, but never in the face of such brewing discontent as was
prevalent in Lloyd's at that time. It was an occasion when the older
man would have shut down, but Robert had, along with his arbitrary
impetuosity, a real dislike to shut down on account of the men, for
which they would have been the last to give him credit. &ldquo;Poor
devils,&rdquo; he told himself, standing in the office window one
night, and seeing them pour out and disappear into the early darkness
beyond the radius of the electric-lights, &ldquo;I can't turn them
adrift without a dollar in midwinter. I'll try to run the factory a
while longer on a reduced scale, if I only meet expenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw Ellen going out, descending the steps with the Atkins
girls, and as she passed the light, her fair head shone out for a
second like an aureole. A great wave of tenderness came over him. He
reflected that it would make no difference to her, that it was only a
question of time before he lifted her forever out of the ranks of
toil. The impulse was strong upon him to go to see her that night,
but he had set himself to wait three months after his aunt's death,
and the time was not yet up. He had a feeling that he might seem to
be, and possibly would be, taking advantage of his bereavement if he
went sooner, and that Ellen herself might think so.</p>

<p>It was that very night that Ellen had gone to bed early, to prove
not only to her mother but to herself that she did not expect him,
and the men came to see Andrew. Once she heard Amos Lee's voice
raised to a higher pitch than ever, and distinguished every word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you he's goin' to cut the wages to-morrow,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>There was a low rumble of response, which Ellen could not
understand, but Lee's answer made it evident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;It is in the
air. He don't tell any more than his uncle did; but you wait and see,
that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe it,&rdquo; the girl up-stairs said to
herself, indignantly and loyally. &ldquo;He can't cut the wages of
all those poor men, he with all his uncle's money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the next morning the reduced price-list was posted on the
walls of the different rooms in Lloyd's.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLVII</h3>

<p>There was a driving snow-storm the next day. When Ellen started
for the factory the white twilight of early morning still lingered.
Everywhere were the sons and daughters of toil plodding laboriously
and noiselessly through the snow, each keeping in the track of the
one who went before. There was no wind blowing, and the snow was in a
blue-white level; the trees bent stiffly and quietly beneath a heavy
shag of white, and now and then came a clamor of birds, which served
to accentuate the silence and peace. Ellen could always be forced by
an extreme phase of nature to forgetfulness of her own stresses. For
the time being she forgot everything; her vain watching for Robert,
the talk of trouble in the factory, the disappointment in her
home&mdash;all were forgotten in the contemplation, or rather in the
absorbing, of this new-old wonder of snow.</p>

<p>There was a survival of the old Greek spirit in the girl, and had
she come to earth without her background of orthodox traditions, she
might have easily found her own deities in nature. The peace of the
snow enveloped her soul as well as the earth, and she became a
beneficiary of the white storm; the graceful droop of the pine boughs
extended to her thoughts, and the clamor of the birds aroused in her
a winged freedom, so that she felt at once peace and a sort of
ecstasy. She walked in the track of a stolidly plodding man before
her, as different a person as if she were an inhabitant of another
planet. He was digesting the soggy, sweet griddle-cakes which he had
eaten for breakfast, and revolving in his mind two errands for his
wife&mdash;one, a pail of lard; the other, three yards of black dress
braid; he was considering the surface scum of existence, that which
pertained solely to his own petty share of it; the girl, the clear
residue of life which was, and had been, and would be. Each was on
the way to humble labor for daily bread, but with a difference of
eternity between them.</p>

<p>But when Ellen reached the end of the cross street where the
Atkins girls lived, she heard a sound which dispelled her rapt state.
Her far vision became a near one; she saw, as it were, the clouded
window-glass between her mortal eyes and the beyond, and the sound of
a cough brought it about. Abby and Maria were coming towards her
through the snow. Maria was coughing violently, and Abby was scolding
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care anything about it, Maria Atkins,&rdquo; Abby
was saying, &ldquo;you ought to be ashamed of yourself coming out
such a morning as this. There isn't any sense in it. You know you'll
catch cold, and then there'll be two of you to take care of. You
don't help a mite doing so, you needn't think you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Abby caught sight of Ellen she hastened forward, while Maria,
still coughing, trailed behind, lifting her little, heavy, snow-bound
feet wearily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, I wish you'd tell Maria to turn around and go
home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just hear her cough, and out in all
this snow, and getting her skirts draggled. She hasn't got
common-sense, you tell her so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen stopped, nodding assentingly. &ldquo;I think she's right,
Maria,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You ought not to be out such a morning
as this. You had better go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria came up smiling, though her lips were quite white, and she
controlled her cough to convulsive motions of her chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no worse than usual,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I feel
better than I generally do in the morning. I haven't coughed any
more, if I have as much, and I am holding my dress up high, and you
know how warm the factory is. It will be enough sight warmer than it
is at home. It is cold at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lloyd don't have to save coal,&rdquo; said Abby, bitterly,
&ldquo;but that don't alter the fact of your getting your skirts
draggled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria pulled up her skirts so high that she exposed her slender
ankles, then seeing that she had done so, she let them fall with a
quick glance at two men behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The snow will shake right off; it's light, Abby,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't light. I should think you might listen to Ellen,
if you won't to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen pressed close to Maria, and pulled her thin arm through her
own. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don't you
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Maria burst out with a pitiful emphasis. &ldquo;I've got to
go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Father had a bad spell last night; he
can't get out. He'll lose his place this time, we are afraid, and
there's a note coming due that father says he's paid, but the man
didn't give it up, and he's got to pay it over again; the lawyer says
there is no other way, and we can't let John Sargent do everything.
He's got a sister out West he's about supporting since her husband
died last fall. I've got to go to work; we've got to have the money,
Ellen, and as for my cough, I have always coughed. It hasn't killed
me yet, and I guess it won't yet for a while.&rdquo;  Maria said the
last with a reckless gayety which was unusual to her.</p>

<p>Abby trudged on ahead with indignant emphasis. &ldquo;I'd like to
know what good it is going to do to work and earn and pay up money if
everybody is going to be killed by it?&rdquo; she said, without
turning her head.</p>

<p>Ellen pulled up Maria's coat-collar around her neck and put an
extra fold of her dress-skirt into her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, you can hold it up as high as that, it looks all
right,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish Robert Lloyd had to get up at six o'clock and trudge
a mile in this snow to his work,&rdquo; said Abby, with sudden
viciousness. &ldquo;He'll be driven down in his Russian sleigh by a
man looking like a drum-major, and cut our poor little wages, and
that's all he cares. Who's earning the money, he or us, I'd like to
know? I hate the rich!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it's true, what you say,&rdquo; said Maria, &ldquo;it
seems to me it's like hating those you have given things to, and
that's worse than hating your enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't say given, say been forced to hand over,&rdquo;
retorted Abby, fiercely; &ldquo;and don't preach, Maria Atkins, I
hate preaching; and do have sense enough not to talk when you are out
in this awful storm. You can keep your mouth shut, if you can't do
anything else!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen had turned quite white at Abby's words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't think that he means to cut the wages?&rdquo; she
said, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he does. I had it straight. Wait till you get to the
shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait. Norman Lloyd was as hard as nails, and the young
one is just like him.&rdquo;  Abby looked relentlessly at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it isn't so,&rdquo; whispered Maria to Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe it is,&rdquo; responded Ellen, but Abby
heard them, and turned with a vicious jerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you wait!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>The moment Ellen reached the factory she realized that something
unwonted had happened. There were groups of men, talking, oblivious
even of the blinding storm, which was coming in the last few minutes
with renewed fury, falling in heavy sheets like dank shrouds.</p>

<p>Ellen saw one man in a muttering group throw out an arm, whitened
like a branch of a tree, and shake a rasped, red fist at the splendid
Russian sleigh of the Lloyd's, which was just gliding out of sight
with a flurry of bells and a swing of fur tails, the whole surmounted
by the great fur hat of the coachman. Abby turned and looked fiercely
at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>Even then Ellen would not believe. She caught a glimpse of
Robert's fair head at the office window, and a great impulse of love
and loyalty came over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe it,&rdquo; she said aloud to Maria. Maria
held her arm tightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it isn't so,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But when they entered the room where they worked, there was a
sullen group before a placard tacked on the wall. Ellen pressed
closely, and saw what it was&mdash;a reduced wage-list. Then she went
to her machine.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLVIII</h3>

<p>Ellen had a judicial turn of mind, as her school-master had once
said of her. She was able to look at matters from more than one
stand-point, but she reasoned with a New Testament clearness of
impartiality. She was capable of uncompromising severity, since she
brought such a clear light of youth and childhood to bear upon even
those things which needed shadows for their true revelation.
Everything was for her either black or white. She had not lived long
enough, perhaps she never would, for a comprehension of half-tones.
The situation to her mind was perfectly simple, and she viewed it
with a candor which was at once terrible and cruel, for it involved
cruelty not only to Robert but to herself. She said to herself, here
was this rich man, this man with accumulation of wealth, not one
dollar of which he had earned himself, either by his hands or his
brains, but which had been heaped up for his uncle by the heart and
back breaking toil of all these poor men and women; and now he was
going to abuse his power of capital, his power to take the bread out
of their mouths entirely, by taking it out in part. He was going to
reduce their wages, he was deliberately going to cause privation, and
even suffering where there were large families. She felt the most
unqualified dissent and indignation, and all the love which she had
for the man only intensified it. Love, with a girl like this, tended
to clearness of vision instead of blindness. She judged him as she
would have judged herself. As she stood working at her machine,
stitching linings to vamps, she kept a sharply listening ear for what
went on about her, but there was very little to hear after work had
fairly commenced and the great place was in full hum. The demand of
labor was so imperative that the laborers themselves were merged in
it; they ceased to be for the time, and, instead of living, they
became parts of the struggle for life. A man hustling as if the world
were at stake to get his part of a shoe finished as soon as another
man, so as not to clog and balk the whole system, had no time for
rebellion. He was in the whirlpool which was mightier than himself
and his revolt. After all, a man is a small and helpless factor
before his own needs. For a time those whirring machines, which had
been evolved in the first place from the brains of men, and partook
in a manner of both the spirit and the grosser elements of existence,
its higher qualities and its sordid mechanism, like man himself, had
the best of it. The swart arms of the workmen flew at their appointed
tasks, they fed those unsatisfied maws, the factory vibrated with the
heavy thud of the cutting-machines like a pulse, the racks with shoes
in different stages of completion trundled from one department to
another, propelled by men with tense arms and doggedly bent
heads.</p>

<p>Ellen worked with the rest, but she was one of the few whose brain
could travel faster than her hands. She thought as she worked, for
her muscles did not retard her mind. She was composed of two motions,
one within the other, and the central motion was so swift that it
seemed still.</p>

<p>Ed Flynn came down the room and bent over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said. He was too gayly confident to
be entirely respectful, but he had always a timidity of bearing which
sat oddly upon him before Ellen. He looked half boldly, half
wistfully at her fair face, and challenged her with gay eyes, which
had in their depths a covert seriousness.</p>

<p>Ellen stood between Abby Atkins and Sadie Peel at her work. Sadie
Peel turned on the foreman coquettishly and said, &ldquo;You'd better
go an' talk to Mamie Brady, she's got on a new blue bow on her red
hair. Why don't you give her some better work than tying those old
shoes? Here she's been workin' in this shop two years. You needn't
come shinin' round Ellen an' me! We don't want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flynn colored angrily and shot a vicious glance at the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a pretty hard storm,&rdquo; he said to Ellen, as if
the other girl had not spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn't pretend you don't hear me, Ed Flynn,&rdquo;
called out the girl. Her cheap finery was in full force that morning,
not a lock of her brown hair was unstudied in its arrangement, and
she was as conscious of her pose before her machine as if she had
been on the stage. She knew just how her slender waist and the
graceful slope of her shoulders appeared to the foreman, and her
voice, in spite of its gay rallying and audacity, was wheedling.</p>

<p>Flynn caught hold of her shoulders, round and graceful under her
flannel blouse, and shook her, half in anger, half in weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shut up, you witch,&rdquo; said he. Then he turned to
Ellen again, and his whole manner and expression changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry about that new list,&rdquo; he said, very low, in
her ear. Ellen never looked at him, and did not make a motion as if
she heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a hard storm,&rdquo; the foreman said again, almost
appealingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is very hard,&rdquo; replied Ellen, slipping
another shoe under the needles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth ails you this morning, Ellen Brewster?&rdquo;
Sadie Peel said to her, when the foreman had gone. &ldquo;You look
queer and act queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen ain't in the habit of joking with Ed Flynn,&rdquo;
said Abby Atkins, on the other side, with sarcastic emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, don't you feel big!&rdquo; sneered Sadie Peel. There
was always a jarring inconsequence about this girl, she was so
delicately pretty and refined in appearance, her ribbons were so
profuse and cheap, and her manners were so recklessly coarse.</p>

<p>Ellen said nothing, but worked steadily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mame Brady's just gone on Ed Flynn, and he goes with her
just enough to keep her hangin', and I don't believe he means to
marry her, and I think it's mean,&rdquo; said Sadie Peel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ought to have more sense than to take any stock in
him,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ain't the only one,&rdquo; said Sadie. &ldquo;Nellie
Stone in the office has been daft over him since she's been there,
and he don't look at her. I don't see what there is about Ed Flynn,
for my part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; said Abby, dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know. He's pretty good-looking,&rdquo; said
Sadie Peel, &ldquo;and he's got a sort of a way with him.&rdquo;  All
the time the girl was talking her heart was aching. The foreman had
paid her some little attention, which she had taken seriously, but
nobody except her father had known it, or known when he had fallen
off. Sometimes Flynn, meeting the father's gaze as he passed him at
his work at the cutting-bench, used to waver involuntarily, though he
asked himself with perfect good faith what was it all about, for he
had done the girl no harm. He felt more guilty concerning Mamie
Brady.</p>

<p>Ellen worked on, with her fingers flying and her forehead tense
with thought. The chatter of the girls ceased. They were too busy to
keep it up. The hum of work continued. Once Ellen knew, although she
did not see him, by some subtle disturbance of the atmosphere, a
little commotion which was perfectly silent, that Robert Lloyd had
entered the room. She knew when he passed her, and she worked more
swiftly than ever. After he had gone out there was a curiously
inarticulate sound like a low growl of purely animal dissent over the
room; a word of blasphemy sounded above the din of the machines. Then
all went on as before until the noon whistle blew.</p>

<p>Even then there was not so much discussion as might have been
expected. Robert, since the storm was so heavy, remained in the
office, and sent a boy out for a light luncheon, and the foremen were
much in evidence. There was always an uncertainty about their
sentiments, occupying as they did a position half-way between
employer and employ&eacute;s; and then, too, they were not affected
by the cut in wages. The sentiments of the unaffected are always a
matter of suspicion to those who suffer themselves. There were
grumblings carried on in a low key behind Flynn's back, but the
atmosphere for the most part was one of depression. Ellen ate her
luncheon with Maria and Abby. Willy Jones came up timidly when they
were nearly finished, feeling his way with a remark about the storm,
which was increasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the cars are tied up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the
noon train isn't in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned, with a curious effort at concealment from them all and
himself, upon the corner of the bench near Abby. Then a young man
passed them, with such an air of tragedy and such a dead-white face
that they all stared after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world ails you, Ben Simmons?&rdquo; called out
Sadie Peel. But he did not act as if he heard. He crossed vehemently
to the other side of the room, and stood at a window, looking out at
the fierce white slant of the storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in creation ails him?&rdquo; cried Sadie Peel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I know,&rdquo; Willy Jones volunteered,
timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was going to get married, and this cut in his wages is
going to put a stop to it. I heard him say so this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married! Who to?&rdquo; asked Sadie Peel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Floretta Vining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My land!&rdquo; cried Sadie Peel. &ldquo;So she did take up
with him after the school-teacher went away. I always said she would.
I always knew Edward Harris wouldn't marry her, and I always said Ben
Simmons would get her if he hung on long enough. Floretta was bound
to marry somebody; she wasn't going to wind up an old maid; and if
she couldn't get one, she'd take another. I suppose Ben has got that
sick sister of his to do for since her father died, and thinks he
can't get married with any less pay. Floretta won't make a very cheap
wife. She's bound to have things whether or no, and Ben 'ain't never
earned so much as some. He's awful steady, but he's slow as cold
molasses, and he won't let his sister suffer for no
Floretta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so; I don't believe he would,&rdquo; said Abby.
&ldquo;What any man in his senses wants a doll like that for enough
to look as if he was dead when he's got to put off marrying
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's because you ain't a man, Abby Atkins,&rdquo; said
Sadie Peel. &ldquo;All the men think of is looks, and little fine
airs and graces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as if they might get along,&rdquo; ventured Willy
Jones, &ldquo;as if they might do with less for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ellen turned to him unexpectedly. &ldquo;There's no use in
talking about doing with less when every single cent has to
count,&rdquo; said she, sternly. &ldquo;Ben Simmons has his taxes and
insurance, and a steady doctor's bill for his sister, and medicines
to buy. He can't have laid up a cent, for he's slow, though he's a
good workman. You can't do with less when you haven't any more than
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Abby. Then she turned a tender,
conciliating, indulgent gaze on the young man at her side. &ldquo;If
I were Floretta Vining,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and if Ellen were, we
would go without things, and never know it. We'd go to work; but
Floretta, she's different. We went to school with Floretta
Vining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Floretta Vining is dreadful fond of men, but she wouldn't
go without a yard of ribbon for one if he was dying,&rdquo; said
Sadie Peel, conclusively. &ldquo;It's awful hard on Ben Simmons, and
no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Amos Lee, coming up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what's hard on all of us? What's the use of
asking?&rdquo; said the girl, with a bitter coquetry. &ldquo;I
shouldn't think any man with horse-sense would ask what's hard on us
when he's seen the ornaments tacked up all over the shop this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Lee, with a glance over his
shoulder. Flynn was at the other end of the room. Granville Joy,
Dixon, and one or two other men were sauntering up. For a second the
little group looked at one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Ellen, in a low
voice, which had an intonation that caused the others to start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I'll do, if I can get enough to back me,&rdquo;
cried Lee, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush up!&rdquo; said Sadie Peel. Then her father came along
smiling his imperturbable smile on his wide face, which had a
Slavonic cast, although he was New England born and bred. He looked
from one to the other without saying a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We're deciding whether to strike or not, father,&rdquo;
said Sadie, in a flippant manner. She raised a hand and adjusted a
stray lock of hair as she spoke, then she straightened her ribbon
stock. Her father said nothing, but his face assumed a stolidity of
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I'll do,&rdquo; proclaimed Amos Lee again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush up!&rdquo; cried Sadie Peel again, with a giggle.
&ldquo;Here's Ed Flynn.&rdquo;  And the foreman came sauntering up as
the one-o'clock whistle blew, and the workers sprang to their posts
of work.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter XLIX</h3>

<p>The snow increased all day. When the six-o'clock whistle blew, and
the workmen streamed out of the factories, it was a wild waste of
winter and storm. The wind had come up, and the light snow arose in
the distance like white dancers of death, spinning furiously over the
level, then settling into long, gravelike ridges. Ellen glanced into
the office as she passed the door, and saw Robert Lloyd talking
busily with Flynn and another foreman by the name of Dennison. As she
passed, Robert turned with a look as if he had been watching for her,
and came forward hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brewster!&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>Mamie Brady, following close behind, gave Ellen an admonishing
nudge. &ldquo;Boss wants to see you,&rdquo; she whispered, loudly.
Ellen stopped, and Robert came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please step in here a moment, Miss Brewster,&rdquo; he
said, and colored a little.</p>

<p>Granville Joy, who was following Ellen, looked keenly at him, some
one sniggered aloud, and a girl said quite audibly, &ldquo;My
land!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen followed Robert into the office, and he bent over her,
speaking rapidly, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not walk home in this snow,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and the cars are not running. You must let me take you. My
sleigh is at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen turned white. Somehow this protecting care for herself, in
the face of all which she had been considering that day, gave her a
tremendous shock. She felt at once touched and more indignant than
she had ever been in her whole life. She had been half believing that
Robert was neglecting her, that he had forgotten her; all day she had
been judging his action of cutting the wages of the workmen from her
unswerving, childlike, unshadowed point of view, and now this little
evidence of humanity towards her, in the face of what she considered
wholesale inhumanity towards others, made her at once severe to him
and to herself, and she forced back sternly the leap of pleasure and
happiness which this thought of her awakened. &ldquo;No, thank
you,&rdquo; she said, shortly; &ldquo;I am much obliged, but I would
rather walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you cannot, in this storm,&rdquo; pleaded Robert, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can; it is no worse for me than for others. There is
Maria Atkins, she has been coughing all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take her too. Ellen, you cannot walk. You must let
me take you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged, but I would rather not,&rdquo; replied
Ellen, in an icy tone. She looked quite hard in his face.</p>

<p>Robert looked at her perplexed. &ldquo;But it is drifting,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no worse for me than for the others.&rdquo;  Ellen
turned to go. Her attitude of rebuff was unmistakable.</p>

<p>Robert colored. &ldquo;Very well; I will not urge you,&rdquo; he
said, coldly. Then he returned to his desk, and Ellen went out. She
caught up with Maria Atkins, who was struggling painfully through the
drifts, leaning on Abby's arm, and slipped a hand under her thin
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect nothing but she'll get her death out in this
storm,&rdquo; grumbled Abby. &ldquo;What did he want,
Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing in particular,&rdquo; replied Ellen. Uppermost in
her mind at that moment was the charge of cruelty against Robert for
not taking her hint as to Maria. &ldquo;He can ask me to ride because
he has amused himself with me, but as for taking this poor girl, whom
he does not love, when it may mean life or death to her, he did not
think seriously of doing that for a moment,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>Maria was coughing, although she strove hard to smother the
coughs. Granville Joy, who was plodding ahead, turned and waited
until they came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better let me carry you, Maria,&rdquo; he said,
jocularly, but his honest eyes were full of concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is enough sight kinder than Robert Lloyd,&rdquo; thought
Ellen; &ldquo;he has a better heart.&rdquo;  And then the splendid
Lloyd sleigh came up behind them and stopped, tilting to a drift.
Robert, in his fur-lined coat, sprang out and went up to Maria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please let me take you home,&rdquo; he said, kindly.
&ldquo;You have a cold, and this storm is too severe for you to be
out. Please let me take you home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria looked at him, fairly gasping with astonishment. She tried
to speak, but a cough choked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better go if Mr. Lloyd will take you,&rdquo; Abby
said, decisively. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Lloyd; she isn't fit to be
out.&rdquo;  She urged her sister towards the sleigh, and Robert
assisted her into the fur-lined nest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can sit with the driver,&rdquo; said Robert to Abby,
&ldquo;if you will come with your sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Abby. &ldquo;I am able to
walk, but I will be much obliged if you will take Maria
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert sprang in beside Maria, and the sleigh slid out of
sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never!&rdquo; said Abby. Ellen said nothing, but plodded
on, her eyes fixed on the snowy track.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad she had a chance to ride,&rdquo; said Granville
Joy, in a tentative voice. He looked uneasily at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It beats the Dutch,&rdquo; said Abby. She also regarded
Ellen with sympathy and perplexity. When they reached the street
where she lived, up which the sleigh had disappeared, she let
Granville go on ahead, and she spoke to Ellen in a low tone.
&ldquo;Why didn't he ask you?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn't?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care to accept favors from a man who oppresses all
my friends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was good to take in Maria,&rdquo; said Abby, in a
perplexed voice. &ldquo;His uncle would never have thought of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen made no reply. She stood still in the drifting snow, with
her mouth shut hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You feel as if this cutting wages was a pretty hard
thing?&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so do I. I wonder what they will do about it. I don't
know how the men feel. Somehow, folks can't seem to think or plan
much in a storm like this. There's the sleigh coming back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; Ellen said, hurriedly, and trudged on as
fast as she was able in order not to have the Lloyd sleigh pass her;
it had to turn after reaching the end of the street. Ellen caught up
with Granville Joy. Robert, glancing over the waving fringe of fur
tails, saw disappearing in the pale gleam of the electric-light the
two dim figures veiled by the drifting snow. He thought to himself,
with a sharp pain, that perhaps, after all, Granville Joy was the
reason for her rebuff. It never occurred to him that his action in
cutting the wages could have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>Ellen went along with Granville, who was anxious to offer her his
arm, but did not quite dare. He kept thrusting out an elbow in her
direction, and an inarticulate invitation died in his throat.
Finally, when they reached an unusually high drift of snow, he
plucked up sufficient courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my arm, won't you?&rdquo; he said, with a pitiful
attempt at ease, then stared as if he had been shot, at Ellen's
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it is easier
to walk alone in snow like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is,&rdquo; assented Granville, dejectedly. He
walked on, scuffling as hard as he could to make a path for Ellen
with the patient faithfulness of a dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do about the cut in wages?&rdquo;
Ellen asked, presently.</p>

<p>Granville started. The sudden transition from personalities to
generalities confused him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Ellen repeated her question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Granville. &ldquo;I don't think
the boys have made up their minds. I don't know what they will do.
They have been weeding out union men. I suppose the union would have
something to say about it otherwise. I don't know what we will
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't think there would be very much doubt as to what
to do,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Granville stared at her over his shoulder in a perplexed, admiring
fashion. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't think there would be any doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know. It is a pretty serious thing to get out
of work in midwinter for a good many of us, and as long as the union
isn't in control, other men can come in. I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that I do not think it right, that it is unjust, and
I believe in resisting injustice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men have resisted injustice ever since the Creation,&rdquo;
said Granville, in a bitter voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, resistance can continue as long as life lasts,&rdquo;
returned Ellen. Just then came a fiercer blast than ever, laden with
a stinging volley of snow, and seemed to sweep the words from the
girl's mouth. She bent before it involuntarily, and the conviction
forced itself upon her that, after all, resistance to injustice might
be as futile as resistance to storm, that injustice might be one of
the primal forces of the world, and one of the conditions of its
endurance, and yet with the conviction came the renewed resolution to
resist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can poor men do against capital unless they are backed
up by some labor organization?&rdquo; asked Granville. &ldquo;And I
don't believe there are a dozen in the factory who belong to the
union. There has been an understanding, without his ever saying so
that I know of, that the old boss didn't approve of it. So lots of us
kept out of it, we wanted work so bad. What can we do against such
odds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When right is on your side, you have all the odds,&rdquo;
said Ellen, looking back over her snow-powdered shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you would strike?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't submit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know how the boys feel,&rdquo; said
Granville. &ldquo;I suppose we'll have to talk it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't need to talk it over,&rdquo; said Ellen.
&ldquo;You've gone past your house, Granville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't going to let you go home alone in such a storm as
this,&rdquo; said Granville, in a tender voice, which he tried to
make facetious. &ldquo;I wouldn't let any girl go home alone in such
a storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen stopped short. &ldquo;I don't want you to go home with me,
thank you, Granville,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your mother will have
supper ready, and I can go just as well alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, I won't let you go alone,&rdquo; said the young man,
as a wilder gust came. &ldquo;Suppose you should fall
down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fall down!&rdquo; repeated Ellen, with a laugh, but her
regard of the young man, in spite of her rebuff, was tender. He
touched her with his unfailing devotion; the heavy trudging by her
side of this poor man meant, she told herself, much more than the
invitation of the rich one to ride behind his bays in his luxurious
sleigh. This meant the very bone and sinew of love. She held out her
little, mittened hand to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Granville,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Granville caught it eagerly. &ldquo;Oh, Ellen,&rdquo; he
murmured.</p>

<p>But she withdrew her hand quickly. &ldquo;We have always been good
friends, and we always will be,&rdquo; said she, and her tone was
unmistakable. The young man shrank back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we always will, Ellen,&rdquo; he said, in a faithful
voice, with a note of pain in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Ellen again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; responded Granville, and turned his
plodding back on the girl and retraced his laborious steps towards
his own home, which he had just passed. There come times for all
souls when the broad light of the path of humanity seems to pale to
insignificance before the intensity of the one little search-light of
personality. Granville Joy felt as if the eternal problem of the rich
and poor, of labor and capital, of justice and equality, was as
nothing before the desire of his heart for that one girl who was
disappearing from his sight behind the veil of virgin snow.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter L</h3>

<p>When Ellen came in sight of her house that night she saw her
father's bent figure moving down the path with sidewise motions of a
broom. He had been out at short intervals all the afternoon, that she
should not have to wade through drifts to the door. The
electric-light shone full on this narrow, cleared track and the
toiling figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, father!&rdquo; Ellen called out. Andrew turned, and
his face lit with love and welcome and solicitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be you dreadful snowy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, father, not very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's an awful storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty bad, but I got along all right. The snow-plough has
been out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute till I get this swept,&rdquo; said Andrew,
sweeping violently before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn't have bothered, father,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'ain't anything else to do,&rdquo; replied Andrew, in a
sad voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's mother watching,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she's been diggin' at them wrappers all
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she has,&rdquo; Ellen returned, in a bitter tone.
Her father stared at her. Ellen never spoke like that. For the first
time she echoed him and her mother. Something like terror came over
him at the sound of that familiar note of his own life from this
younger one. He seemed to realize dimly that a taint of his nature
had descended upon his child.</p>

<p>When Ellen entered the house, the warm air was full of savory
odors of toast and tea and cooking meat and vegetables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better go right up-stairs and put on a dry dress,
Ellen,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I put your blue one out on your bed,
and your shoes are warming by the sitting-room stove. I've been
worrying as to how you were going to get home all day.&rdquo;  Then
she stopped short as she caught sight of Ellen's face. &ldquo;What on
earth is the matter, Ellen Brewster?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look queer. Has anything happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, something has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew turned pale. He stood in the entry with his snowy broom in
hand, staring from one to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing that you need worry about,&rdquo; said Ellen.
&ldquo;I'll tell you when I get my dress changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen pulled off her rubbers, and went up-stairs to her chamber.
Fanny and Andrew stood looking at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't suppose&mdash;&rdquo; whispered Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose what?&rdquo; responded Fanny, sharply.</p>

<p>They continued to look at each other. Fanny answered Andrew as if
he had spoken, with that jealous pride for her girl's self-respect
which possessed her even before the girl's father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land, it ain't that,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You wouldn't
catch Ellen lookin' as if anything had come across her for such a
thing as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose she wouldn't,&rdquo; said Andrew; and he
actually blushed before his wife's eyes.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mrs. Wetherhed had been in, and told Fanny that she
had heard that Robert Lloyd was to be married to Maud Hemingway; and
both Andrew and Fanny had thought of that as the cause of Ellen's
changed face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better take that broom out into the shed, and get the
snow off yourself, and come in and shut the door,&rdquo; Fanny said,
shortly. &ldquo;You're colding the house all off, and Amabel has got
a cold, and she's sitting right in the draught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Andrew, meekly, though Fanny had
herself been holding the sitting-room door open. In those days Andrew
felt below his moral stature as head of the house. Actually, looking
at Fanny, who was earning her small share towards the daily bread,
she seemed to him much taller than he, though she was a head shorter.
He thought so little of himself, he seemed to see himself as through
the wrong end of a telescope. Fanny went into the sitting-room and
shut the door with a bang. Amabel did not look up from her book. She
was reading a library book much beyond her years, and sniffing
pathetically with her cold. Amabel had begun to discover an
omnivorous taste for books, which stuck at nothing. She understood
not more than half of what she read, but seemed to relish it like
indigestible food.</p>

<p>When Ellen came down-stairs, and sat beside the coal stove to
change her shoes, she looked at the book which Amabel was reading.
&ldquo;You ought not to read that book, dear,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Let Ellen get you a better one for a little girl
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Amabel, without paying the slightest heed to Ellen's words,
looked up at her with amazement, as Andrew and Fanny had done.
&ldquo;What's the matter, Ellen?&rdquo; she asked, in her little,
hoarse voice.</p>

<p>Fanny and Andrew, who had just entered, stood waiting. Ellen bent
over her shoe, drawing in the strings firmly and evenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lloyd has reduced the wage-list,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Andrew, in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten per cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. Andrew and Fanny looked at Ellen like
people who are uncertain of their next move; Amabel stared from one
to the other with her weak, watery eyes. Ellen continued to lace her
shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it, Ellen?&rdquo; asked Andrew,
almost timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know of only one thing to think,&rdquo; replied Ellen, in
a dogged voice.</p>

<p>As she spoke she pulled the tag off a shoe-string because it would
not go through the eyelet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Fanny, in a hard voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is cruelty and tyranny,&rdquo; said Ellen,
pulling the rough end of the string through the eyelet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose the times are pretty hard,&rdquo; ventured
Andrew; but Ellen cut him short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert Lloyd has half a million, which has been accumulated
by the labor of poor men in prosperous times,&rdquo; said she, with
her childlike severity and pitilessness. &ldquo;There is no question
about the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Fanny flung all self-interest to the wind and was at her
daughter's side like a whirlwind. The fact that the two were of one
blood was never so strongly evident. Red spots glowed in the elder
woman's cheeks and her black eyes blazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen's right,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;she's right. For a
man worth half a million to cut down the wages of poor, hard-working
folks in midwinter is cruelty. I don't care who does it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Fanny opened her mouth to tell Ellen of the rumor concerning
Robert's engagement to Maud Hemingway, then she refrained, for some
reason which she could not analyze. In her heart she did not believe
the report to be true, and considered the telling of it a slight to
Ellen, but it influenced her in her indignation against Robert for
the wage-cutting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they going to do?&rdquo; asked Andrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he&mdash;young Lloyd&mdash;talk to the men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; notices were tacked up all over the shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the way his uncle would have done,&rdquo; said
Andrew, in a curious voice of bitterness and respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you don't know what they are going to do?&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know what I would do,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I
never would give in, if I starved&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LI</h3>

<p>When Ellen started for the factory the next morning the storm had
not ceased; the roads were very heavy, although the snow-plough had
been out at intervals all night, and there was a struggling line of
shovelling men along the car-track, but the cars were still unable to
penetrate the drifts. When Ellen passed her grandmother's house the
old woman tapped sharply on the window and motioned her back
frantically with one bony hand. The window was frozen to the sill
with the snow, and she could not raise it. Ellen shook her head,
smiling. Her grandmother continued to wave her back, the lines of
forbidding anxiety in her old face as strongly marked as an etching
in the window frame. This love, which had at once coerced and fondled
the girl since her birth, was very precious to her. This protection,
which she was forced to repel, smote her like a pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old grandmother!&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;there she
will worry about me all day because I have gone out in the
storm.&rdquo;  She turned back and waved her hand and nodded
laughingly; but the old woman continued that anxiously imperative
backward motion until Ellen was out of sight.</p>

<p>Ellen walked in the car-track, as did everybody else, that being
better cleared than the rest of the road. She was astonished that she
heard nothing of the cut in wages from the men. There seemed to be no
excitement at all. They merely trudged heavily along, their whitening
bodies bent before the storm. There was an unusual doggedness about
this march to the factory this morning, but that was all. Ellen
returned the muttered greeting of several, and walked along in
silence with the rest. Even when Abby Atkins joined her there was
little said. Ellen asked for Maria, and Abby replied that she had
taken more cold yesterday, and could not speak aloud; then relapsed
into silence, making her way through the snow with a sort of taciturn
endurance. Ellen looked at the struggling procession of which she was
a part, all slanting with the slant of the storm, and a fancy seized
her that rebellion and resistance were hopeless, that those parallel
lines of yielding to the onslaughts of fate were as inevitable as
life itself, one of its conditions. Men could not help walking that
way when the bitter storm-wind was blowing; they could not help
living that way when fate was in array against their progress. Then,
thinking so, a mightier spirit of revolt than she had ever known
awoke within her. She, as she walked, straightened herself. She
leaned not one whit before the drive of the storm. She advanced with
no yielding in her, her brave face looking ahead through the white
blur of snow with a confidence which was almost exultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think the men will do?&rdquo; she said to Abby
when they came in sight of Lloyd's, shaggy with fringes and wreaths
and overhanging shelvings of snow, roaring with machinery, with the
steady stream of labor pouring in the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; repeated Abby, almost listlessly. &ldquo;Do
about what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the cut in wages?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby turned on her with sudden fire. &ldquo;Oh, my God, what can
they do, Ellen Brewster?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Haven't they got
to live? Hasn't Lloyd got it all his own way? How are men to live in
weather like this without work? Bread without butter is better than
none at all, and life at any cost is better than death for them you
love. What can they do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me there is only one thing to do,&rdquo;
replied Ellen.</p>

<p>Abby stared at her wonderingly. &ldquo;You don't
mean&mdash;&rdquo; she said, as they climbed up the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean I would do anything, at whatever cost to myself, to
defeat injustice,&rdquo; said Ellen, in a loud, clear voice.</p>

<p>Several men turned and looked back at her and laughed
bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's easy talking,&rdquo; said one to another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; returned the other.</p>

<p>The people all settled to their work as usual. One of the foremen
(Dennison), who was anxious to curry favor with his employer,
reported to him in an undertone in the office that everything was
quiet. Robert nodded easily. He had not anticipated anything else. In
the course of the morning he looked into the room where Ellen was
employed, and saw with relief and concern her fair head before her
machine. It seemed to him that he could not bear it one instant
longer to have her working in this fashion, that he must lift her out
of it. He still tingled with his rebuff of the night before, but he
had never loved her so well, for the idea that the cut in wages
affected her relation to him never occurred to him. As he walked
through the room none of the workers seemed to notice him, but worked
with renewed energy. He might have been invisible for all the
attention he seemed to excite. He looked with covert tenderness at
the back of Ellen's head, and passed on. He reflected that he had
adopted the measure of wage-cutting with no difficulty whatever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All it needs is a little firmness,&rdquo; he thought, with
a boyish complacency in his own methods. &ldquo;Now I can keep on
with the factory, and no turning the poor people adrift in
midwinter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At noon Robert put on his fur-lined coat and left the factory,
springing into the sleigh, which had drawn up before the door with a
flurry of bells. He had an errand in the next town that afternoon,
and was not going to return. When the sleigh had slid swiftly out of
sight through the storm, which was lightening a little, the people in
the office turned to one another with a curious expression of
liberty, but even then little was said. Nellie Stone was at the desk
eating her luncheon; Ed Flynn and Dennison and one of the lasters,
who had looked in and then stepped in when he saw Lloyd was gone,
were there. The laster, who was young and coarsely handsome, had an
admiration for the pretty girl at the desk. Presently she addressed
him, with her mouth full of apple-pie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, George, what are you fellows going to do?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>Dennison glanced keenly from one to the other; Flynn shrugged his
shoulders and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as if it was clearing up,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Nellie Stone again,
with a coquettish flirt of her blond fluff of hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grin and bear it, I s'pose,&rdquo; replied the young
laster, with an adoring look at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My land! grin and bear a cut of ten per cent.? Well, I
don't think you've got much spunk, I must say. Why don't you
strike?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who's going to feed us?&rdquo; replied the laster, in a
tender voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feed you? Oh, you don't want much to eat. Join the union.
It's ridiculous so few of the men in Lloyd's belong to it, anyway;
and then the union will feed you, won't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The union did not do what it promised in the Scarboro
strike,&rdquo; interposed Dennison, curtly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we all know where you are, Frank Dennison,&rdquo; said
the girl, with a soft roll of her blue eyes. &ldquo;Besides, it's
easy to talk when you aren't hit. Your wages aren't cut. But here is
George May here, he's in a different box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's got nobody dependent on him, anyway,&rdquo; said
Flynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I wasn't going to get married I'd strike,&rdquo; cried
the young man, with a fervent glance at the girl. She colored, half
pleased, half angry, and the other men chuckled. She took another
bite of pie to conceal her confusion. She preferred Flynn to the
laster, and while she was not averse to proving to the former the
triumph of her charms over another man, did not like too much
concessions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better go and eat your dinner, George May,&rdquo; she
said, in her sweet, shrill voice. &ldquo;First thing you know the
whistle will blow. Here's yours, Ed.&rdquo;  With that she pulled out
a leather bag from under the desk, where she had volunteered to place
it for warmth and safety against the coil of steam-pipes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe your coffee is very cold, Ed,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>The laster glared from one to the other jealously. Dennison went
towards a shelf where he had stored away his luncheon, when he
stopped suddenly and listened, as did the others. There came a great
uproar of applause from the next room beyond. Then it subsided, and a
girl's clear, loud voice was heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo; cried Nellie Stone. She jumped up
and ran to the door, still eating her pie, and the men followed
her.</p>

<p>At the end of one of the work-rooms, backed against a snowy
window, clung about with shreds of the driving storm, stood Ellen
Brewster, with some other girls around her, and a few men on the
outskirts, and a steady, curious movement of all the other workmen
towards her, as of iron filings towards a magnet, and she was
talking.</p>

<p>Her voice was quite audible all over the great room. It was
low-pitched, but had a wonderful carrying quality, and there was
something marvellous in its absolute confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you men will do nothing, and say nothing, it is time for
a girl to say and act,&rdquo; she proclaimed. &ldquo;I did not dream
for a minute that you would yield to this cut in wages. Why should
you have your wages cut?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The times are pretty hard,&rdquo; said a doubtful voice
among her auditors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if the times are hard? What is that to you? Have you
made them hard? It is the great capitalists who have made them hard
by shifting the wealth too much to one side. They are the ones who
should suffer, not you. What have you done, except come here morning
after morning in cold or heat, rain or shine, and work with all your
strength? They who have precipitated the hard times are the ones who
should bear the brunt of them. Your work is the same now as it was
then, the strain on your flesh and blood and muscles is the same,
your pay should be the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Abby Atkins, in a reluctant, surly
fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said another girl, and another. Then
there was a fusilade of hand-claps started by the girls, and somewhat
feebly echoed by the men.</p>

<p>One or two men looked rather uneasily back towards Dennison and
Flynn and two more foremen who had come forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't as though we had something to fall back on,&rdquo;
said a man's grumbling voice. &ldquo;It's easy to talk when you
'ain't got a wife and five children dependent on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said another man, doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has nothing to do with it,&rdquo; said Ellen, firmly.
&ldquo;We can all club together, and keep the wolf from the door for
those who are hardest pressed for a while; and as for me, if I were a
man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused a minute. When she spoke again her voice was full of
childlike enthusiasm; it seemed to ring like a song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were a man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I would go out in
the street and dig&mdash;I would beg, I would steal&mdash;before I
would yield&mdash;I, a free man in a free country&mdash;to tyranny
like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a great round of applause at that. Dennison scowled and
said something in a low voice to another foreman at his side. Flynn
laughed, with a perplexed, admiring look at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; said Tom Peel, slouching on the
outskirts of the throng, and speaking in an imperturbable,
compelling, drawling voice, &ldquo;whether the free men in the free
country are going to kick themselves free, or into tighter places, by
kicking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have got to stop to count the cost of bravery and
standing up for your rights, there would be no bravery in the
world,&rdquo; returned Ellen, with disdain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am ready to kick,&rdquo; said Peel, with his
mask-like smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Granville Joy, in a loud voice. Amos
Lee came rushing through the crowd to Ellen's side. He had been
eating his dinner in another room, and had just heard what was going
on. He opened his mouth with a motion as of letting loose a flood of
ranting, but somebody interposed. John Sargent, bulky and
irresistible in his steady resolution, put him aside and stood before
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said to them all. &ldquo;There may be
truth in what Miss Brewster says, but we must not act hastily; there
is too much at stake. Let us appoint a committee and go to see Mr.
Lloyd this evening, and remonstrate on the cutting of the
wages.&rdquo;  He turned to Ellen in a kindly, half-paternal fashion.
&ldquo;Don't you see it would be better?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully, her cheeks glowing, her eyes like
stars. She was freedom and youth incarnate, and rebellious against
all which she conceived as wrong and tyrannical. She could hardly
admit, in her fire of enthusiasm, of pure indignation, of any
compromise or arbitration. All the griefs of her short life, she had
told herself, were directly traceable to the wrongs of the system of
labor and capital, and were awakening within her as freshly as if
they had just happened.</p>

<p>She remembered her father, exiled in his prime from his place in
the working world by this system of arbitrary employment; she
remembered her aunt in the asylum; poor little Amabel; her own mother
toiling beyond her strength on underpaid work; Maria coughing her
life away. She remembered her own life twisted into another track
from the one which she should have followed, and there was for the
time very little reason or justice in her. That injustice which will
arise to meet its kind in equal combat had arisen in her heart.
Still, she yielded. &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; she said to
Sargent. She had always liked John Sargent, and she respected
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure it is the best course,&rdquo; he said to her,
still in that low, confidential voice.</p>

<p>It ended in a committee of four&mdash;John Sargent, Amos Lee, Tom
Peel, and one of the older lasters, a very respectable man, a deacon
in the Baptist Church&mdash;being appointed to wait on Robert Lloyd
that evening.</p>

<p>When the one-o'clock whistle blew, Ellen went back to her machine.
She was very pale, but she was conscious of a curious steadiness of
all her nerves. Abby leaned towards her, and spoke low in the roar of
wheels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll back you up, if I die for it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But Sadie Peel, on the other side, spoke quite openly, with a
laugh and shrug of her shoulders. &ldquo;Land,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;father'll be with you. He's bound to strike. He struck when he
was in McGuire's. Catch father givin' up anything. But as for me, I
wish you'd all slow up an' stick to work, if you do get a little
less. If we quit work I can't have a nearseal cape, and I've set my
heart on a nearseal cape this winter.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LII</h3>

<p>Ellen resolved that she would say as little as possible about the
trouble at home that night. She did not wish her parents to worry
over it until it was settled in one way or another.</p>

<p>When her mother asked what they had done about the wage-cutting,
she replied that a committee had been appointed to wait on Mr. Lloyd
that evening, and talk it over with him; then she said nothing
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won't give in if he's like his uncle,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>Ellen went on eating her supper in silence. Her father glanced at
her with sharp solicitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he won't,&rdquo; returned Fanny.</p>

<p>Ellen was very pale and her eyes were bright. After supper she
went to the window and pressed her face against the glass, shielding
her eyes from the in-door light, and saw that the storm had quite
ceased. The stars were shining and the white boughs of the trees
lashing about in the northwest wind. She went into the entry, where
she had hung her hat and coat, and began putting them on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Ellen?&rdquo; asked her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just down to Abby's a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't mean to say your are goin' out again in this
snow, Ellen Brewster? I should think you were crazy.&rdquo;  When
Fanny said crazy, she suddenly started and shuddered as if she had
struck herself. She thought of Eva. Always the possibility of a like
doom was in her own mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has stopped snowing, mother,&rdquo; Ellen said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stopped snowing! What if it has? The roads ain't cleared.
You can't get down to Abby Atkins's without gettin' wet up to your
knees. I should think if you got into the house after such a storm
you'd have sense enough to stay in. I've worried just about
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen took off her coat and hat and hung them up again.
&ldquo;Well, I won't go if you feel so, mother,&rdquo; she said,
patiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as if you might get along without seein' Abby
Atkins till to-morrow mornin', when you'd seen her only an hour
ago,&rdquo; Fanny went on, in the high, nagging tone which she often
adopted with those whom she loved the dearest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; said Ellen. It seemed to her that she
must see somebody with whom she could talk about the trouble in the
factory, but she yielded. There was always with the girl a perfect
surface docility, as that she seemed to have no resistance, but a
little way down was a rock-bed of firmness. She lighted her lamp, and
took her library book and went up-stairs to bed to read. But she
could not read, and she could not sleep when she had put aside her
book and extinguished her lamp. She could think of nothing except
Robert, and what he would say to the committee. She lay awake all
night thinking of it. Ellen was a girl who was capable of the most
devoted love, and the most intense dissent and indignation towards
the same person. She could love in spite of faults, and she could see
faults in spite of love. She thought of Robert Lloyd as of the one
human soul whom she loved best out of the whole world, whom she put
before everybody else, even her own self, and she also thought of him
with a wrath which was pitiless and uncompromising, and which seemed
to tear her own heart to pieces, for one cannot be wroth with love
without a set-back of torture. &ldquo;If he does not give in and
raise the wages, I shall hate him,&rdquo; thought Ellen; and her
heart stung her as if at the touch of a hot iron, and then she could
have struck herself for the supposition that he would not give in.
&ldquo;He must,&rdquo; she told herself, with a great fervor of love.
&ldquo;He must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when she went down to breakfast the next morning her mother
stared at her sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen Brewster, what is the matter with you?&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing! You look like a ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel perfectly well,&rdquo; said Ellen. She made an
effort to eat as much breakfast as usual in order that her mother
should not suspect that she was troubled. When at last she set out
for the factory, in the early morning dusk, she was chilled and
trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>The storm had quite ceased, and there was a pale rose-and-violet
dawn-light in the east, and presently came effects like
golden-feathered shafts shooting over the sky. The road was alive
with shovelling men, construction-cars of the railroad company were
laboring back and forth to clear the tracks, householders were making
their way from their doors to their gates, clearing their paths,
lifting up the snow in great, glittering, blue-white blocks on their
clumsy shovels. Everywhere were the factory employ&eacute;s hastening
to their labor; the snow was dropping from the overladen tree
branches in great blobs; there was an incessant, shrill chatter of
people, and occasional shouts. It was the rally of mankind after a
defeat by a primitive force of nature. It was the eternal reassertion
of human life and a higher organization over the elemental. Men who
had walked doggedly the morning before now moved with a spring of
alacrity, although the road was very heavy. There was a new light in
their eyes; their cheeks glowed. Ellen had no doubt whatever that if
Robert Lloyd had not yielded the attitude of the employ&eacute;s of
Lloyd's would be one of resistance. She herself seemed to breathe in
resistance to tyranny, and strength for the right in every breath of
the clear, crisp morning air. She felt as if she could trample on
herself and her own weakness, for the sake of justice and the
inalienable good of her kind, with as little hesitation as she
trampled on the creaking snow. Yet she trembled with that deadly
chill before a sense of impending fate. When she returned the
salutations of her friends on the road she felt that her lips were
stiff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look dreadful queer, Ellen,&rdquo; Abby Atkins said,
anxiously, when she joined her. Maria also was out that morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard what they are going to do?&rdquo; Ellen
asked, in a sort of breathless fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean about the wage-cutting? Don't look so,
Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria pressed close to Ellen, and slid her thin arm through
hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;What did John Sargent say
when he got home last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby hesitated a second, looking doubtfully at Ellen. &ldquo;I
don't see that there is any need for you to take all this so much to
heart,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Abby replied, reluctantly, &ldquo;I believe
Mr. Lloyd wouldn't give in. Ellen Brewster, for Heaven's sake, don't
look so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen walked on, her head high, her face as white as death. Maria
clung closely to her, her own lips quivering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are the men going to do, do you think?&rdquo; asked
Ellen, presently, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Abby. &ldquo;John Sargent
seems to think they'll give in. He says he doesn't know what else
they can do. The times are hard. I believe Amos Lee and Tom Peel are
for striking, but he says he doesn't believe the men will support
them. The amount of it all is, a man with money has got it all his
own way. It's like fighting with bare hands to oppose him, and
getting yourself cut, and not hurting him at all. He's got all the
weapons. We simply can't go without work all winter. It is better to
do with less than with nothing at all. What can a man like Willy
Jones do if he hasn't any work? He and his mother would actually
suffer. What could we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think we ought to think so much about that,&rdquo;
said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think we ought to think about, for goodness'
sake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether we are doing right or not, whether we are
furthering the cause of justice and humanity, or hindering it.
Whether it is for good in the long run or not. There have always been
martyrs; I don't see why it is any harder for us to be martyrs than
for those we read about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sadie Peel came pressing up behind eagerly, her cheeks glowing,
holding up her dress, and displaying a cheap red petticoat.
&ldquo;Ellen Brewster,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if you dare say
anything more to-day I'm goin' to talk. Father is tearing, though he
goes around looking as if he wouldn't jump at a cannon-ball. Do, for
Heaven's sake, keep still; and if you can't get what you want, take
what you can get. I ain't goin' to be cheated out of my nearseal
cape, nohow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sadie Peel, you make me tired,&rdquo; cried Abby Atkins.
&ldquo;I don't say that I'm striking, but I'd strike for all a
nearseal cape. I'm ashamed of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care if you be,&rdquo; said the girl, tossing her
head. &ldquo;A nearseal cape means as much to me as some other things
to you. I want Ellen Brewster to hold her tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen Brewster will hold her tongue or not, just as she has
a mind to,&rdquo; responded Abby, with a snap. She did not like Sadie
Peel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stick up for her if you want to, and get us all into
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall stick up for her, you can be mighty sure of
that,&rdquo; declared Abby.</p>

<p>Ellen walked on as if she heard nothing of it at all, with little
Maria clinging closely to her. Robert Lloyd got out of his sleigh and
went up-stairs just before they reached the factory, and she heard a
very low, subdued mutter of execration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don't mean to strike,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;They mean to submit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All went to their tasks as usual. In a minute after the whistle
blew the great pile was in the full hum of labor. Ellen stood for a
few moments at her machine, then she left it deliberately, and made
her way down the long room to where John Sargent stood at his bench
cutting shoes, with a swift faithfulness born of long practice. She
pressed close to him, while the men around stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is going to be done?&rdquo; she asked, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Sargent turned and looked at her in a troubled fashion, and spoke
in a pacific, soothing tone, as her father might have done. He was
much older than Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here, child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't dare
take the responsibility of urging all these men into starvation this
kind of weather. The times are hard. Lloyd has some
reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen walked away from him swiftly and went to the row of
lasting-machines where Amos Lee and Tom Peel stood. She walked up to
them and spoke in a loud, clear voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going to give in?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You
don't mean to give in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lee turned and gave her one stare, and left his machine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not another stitch of work will I do under this new
wage-list, so help me, God!&rdquo; he proclaimed.</p>

<p>Tom Peel stood for a second like an automaton, staring at them
both. Then he turned back to his post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm with ye,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The lasters, for some occult reason, were always the most
turbulent element in Lloyd's. In less than three minutes the
enthusiasm of revolt had spread, and every laster had left his
machine. In a half-hour more there was an exodus of workmen from
Lloyd's. There were very few left in the factory. Among them were
John Sargent, the laster who was a deacon and had formed one of the
consulting committee, Sadie Peel, who wanted her nearseal cape, and
Mamie Brady, who would do nothing which she thought would displease
the foreman, Flynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If father's mind to be such a fool, it's no reason why I
should,&rdquo; said Sadie Peel, stitching determinedly away. Mamie
Brady looked at Flynn, when he came up to her, with a gentle,
wheedling smile. There was no one near, and she fancied that he might
steal a kiss. But instead he looked at her, frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use you tying away any longer, Mamie,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The strike's on.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LIII</h3>

<p>That was one of the strangest days which Ellen had ever passed.
The enforced idleness gave her an indefinite sense of guilt. She
tried to assist her mother about the household tasks, then she tried
to sew on the wrappers, but she was awkward about it, from long
disuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do take your book and sit down and read and rest a little,
now you've got a chance,&rdquo; said Fanny, with sharp
solicitude.</p>

<p>She said never one word concerning it to Ellen, but all the time
she thought how Ellen had probably lost her lover. It was really
doubtful which suffered the more that day, the mother or the
daughter. Fanny, entirely faithful to her own husband, had yet that
strange vicarious affection for her daughter's lover, and a
realization of her state of mind, of which a mother alone is capable.
It is like a cord of birth which is never severed. Not one shadow of
sad reflection passed over the bright enthusiastic face of the girl
but was passed on, as if driven by some wind of spirit, over the face
of the older woman. She reflected Ellen entirely.</p>

<p>As for Andrew, his anxiety was as tender, and less subtle. He did
not understand so clearly, but he suffered more. He was clumsy with
this mystery of womanhood, but he was unremitting in his efforts to
do something for the girl. Once he tiptoed up to Fanny and whispered,
when Ellen was in the next room, that he hoped she hadn't made any
mistake, that it seemed to him she looked pretty pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistake?&rdquo; cried Fanny, tossing her head, and staring
at him proudly. &ldquo;Haven't you got any spirit, and you a man,
Andrew Brewster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't thinking about myself,&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>And he was quite right. Andrew, left to himself and his purely
selfish interests, could have struck with the foremost. He would
never have considered himself when it came to a question of a
conscientious struggle against injustice, though he was so prone to
look upon both sides of an argument that his decision would have been
necessarily slow; but here was Ellen to consider, and she was more
than himself. While he had been, in the depths of his heart, fiercely
jealous of Robert Lloyd, yet the suspicion that his girl might suffer
because of her renunciation of him hurt him to the quick. Ellen had
told him all she had done in the interests of the strike, and he had
no doubt that her action would effectually put an end to all possible
relations between the two. He tried to imagine how a girl would feel,
and being a man, and measuring all passion by the strength of his
own, he exaggerated her suffering. He could eat nothing, and looked
haggard. He remained out-of-doors the greater part of the day. After
he had cleared his own paths, he secured a job clearing some for a
more prosperous neighbor. Andrew in those days grasped eagerly at any
little job which could bring him in a few pennies. He worked until
dark, and when he went home he saw with a great throb of excitement
the Lloyd sleigh waiting before his door.</p>

<p>Robert had heard from Dennison of Ellen's attitude about the
strike. He had been incredulous at first, as indeed he had been
incredulous about the strike. He had looked out of the office window
with the gaze of one who does not believe what he sees when he had
heard that retreating tramp of the workmen on the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; he said to Dennison, who
entered, pale to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means a strike,&rdquo; replied Dennison. Nellie Stone
rolled her pretty eyes around at the two men from under her fluff of
blond hair. Flynn came in and stood in a curious, non-committal
attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A strike!&rdquo; repeated Robert, vaguely. &ldquo;What
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that he should ask, but he did. The calm
masterfulness of his uncle, which could not even imagine opposition,
had apparently descended upon him.</p>

<p>Both foremen stared at him. Nellie Stone smiled a little
covertly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you know you had a committee wait upon you last night,
Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; replied Dennison.</p>

<p>Flynn looked out of the window at the retreating throngs of
workmen, and gave a whistle under his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they struck because of the wage-cutting?&rdquo; asked
Robert, in a curious, boyish, incredulous, aggrieved tone. Then all
at once he colored violently. &ldquo;Let them strike, then!&rdquo; he
cried. He threw himself into a chair and took up the morning paper,
with its glaring headlines about the unprecedented storm, as if
nothing had happened. Nellie Stone, after a sly wink at Flynn, which
he did not return, began writing again. Flynn went out, and Dennison
remained standing in a rather helpless attitude. A strike in Lloyd's
was unprecedented, but this manner of receiving the news was more
unprecedented still. The proprietor was apparently reading the
morning paper with much interest, when two more foremen, heads of
other departments, came hurrying in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard already,&rdquo; said Robert, in response to
their gasped information. Then he turned another page of the
paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's to be done, sir?&rdquo; said one of the new-comers,
after a prolonged stare at his companion and Dennison. He was a spare
man, with a fierce glimmer of blue eyes under bent brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them strike if they want to,&rdquo; replied Robert.</p>

<p>It was in his mind to explain at length to these men his reasons
for cutting the wages&mdash;for his own attitude as he knew it
himself was entirely reasonable&mdash;but the pride of a proud family
was up in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The strike would never have been on, for the men went to
work quietly enough, if it hadn't been for that Brewster girl,&rdquo;
Dennison said, presently, but rather doubtfully. He was not quite
sure how the information would be received.</p>

<p>Robert dropped his paper, and stared at him with angry
incredulity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What had
Miss Brewster to do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said &ldquo;Miss Brewster&rdquo; with a meaning emphasis of
respect, and Dennison was quick to adopt the hint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; he replied, uneasily, &ldquo;only she
talked with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that Miss Brewster talked to the men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; she said a good deal yesterday, and to-day the men
would not have struck if it had not been for her. It only needs a
spark to set them off sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert was very pale. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, coolly,
&ldquo;there is no need for you to remain longer, since the factory
is shut down. You may as well go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The engineer is seeing to the fires, Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; said
Dennison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;  Robert turned to the girl at the desk.
&ldquo;The factory is closed, Miss Stone,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;there is no need for you to remain longer to-day. Come
to-morrow at ten o'clock, and I will have something for you to do
with regard to settling up accounts. There is nothing in shape
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon Robert went to see Ellen. He could not wait until
evening.</p>

<p>Fanny greeted him at the door, and there was the inevitable flurry
about lighting the parlor stove, and presently Ellen entered.</p>

<p>She had changed the gown which she had worn at her factory-work
for her last winter's best one. Her young face was pale, almost
severe, and she met him in a way which made her seem a stranger.</p>

<p>Robert realized suddenly that she had, as it were, closed the door
upon all their old relations. She seemed years older, and at the same
time indefinably younger, since she was letting the childish
impulses, which are at the heart of all of us untouched by time and
experience, rise rampant and unchecked. She was following the lead of
her own convictions with the terrible unswerving of a child, even in
the face of her own hurt. She was, metaphorically, bumping her own
head against the floor in her vain struggles for mastery over the
mighty conditions of her life.</p>

<p>She bowed to Robert, and did not seem to see his proffered
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you shake hands with me?&rdquo; he asked, almost
humbly, although his own wrath was beginning to rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I would rather not,&rdquo; she replied, with a straight
look at him. Her blue eyes did not falter in the least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I sit down?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have something I
would like to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you wish,&rdquo; she replied. Then she seated
herself on the sofa, with Robert opposite in the crushed-plush
easy-chair.</p>

<p>The room was still very cold, and the breath could be seen at the
lips of each in white clouds. Robert had on his coat, but Ellen had
nothing over her blue gown. It was on Robert's tongue to ask if she
were not cold, then he refrained. The issues at stake seemed to make
the question frivolous to offensiveness. He felt that any approach to
tenderness when Ellen was in her present mood would invoke an
indignation for which he could scarcely blame her, that he must try
to meet her on equal fighting-ground.</p>

<p>Ellen sat before him, her little, cold hands tightly folded in her
lap, her mouth set hard, her steady fire of blue eyes on his face,
waiting for him to speak.</p>

<p>Robert felt a decided awkwardness about beginning to talk.
Suddenly it occurred to him to wonder what there was to say. It
amounted to this: they were in their two different positions, their
two points of view&mdash;would either leave for any argument of the
other? Then he wondered if he could, in the face of a girl who wore
an expression like that, stoop to make an argument, for the utter
blindness and deafness of her very soul to any explanation of his
position was too evident in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I called to tell you, if you will permit me, how much I
regret the unfortunate state of affairs at the factory,&rdquo; Robert
said, and the girl's eyes met his as with a flash of flame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not prevent it, then?&rdquo; asked she. Ellen
had all the fire of her family, but a steadiness of manner which
never deserted her. She was never violent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not prevent it,&rdquo; replied Robert, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Ellen said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake my position,&rdquo; said Robert. It was in his
mind then to lay the matter fully before her, as he had disdained to
do before the committee, but her next words deterred him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand your position very fully,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Robert bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one way of looking at it,&rdquo; said Ellen,
in her inexpressibly sweet, almost fanatical voice. She tossed her
head, and the fluff of fair hair over her temples caught a beam of
afternoon sunlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is only a child,&rdquo; thought Robert, looking at her.
He rose and crossed over to the sofa, and sat down beside her with a
masterful impatience. &ldquo;Look here, Ellen,&rdquo; he said,
leaving all general issues for their own personal ones, &ldquo;you
are not going to let this come between us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen sat stiff and straight, and made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this can make very little difference to you,&rdquo;
Robert urged. &ldquo;You know how I feel. That is, it can make very
little difference to you if you still feel as you did. You must know
that I have only been waiting&mdash;that I am eager and impatient to
lift you out of it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen faced him. &ldquo;Do you think I would be lifted out of it
now?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, but, Ellen, you cannot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can. You do not know me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, you are under a total misapprehension of my
position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not. I apprehend it perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, you cannot let this separate us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked straight ahead in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You at least owe it to me to tell me if, irrespective of
this, your feelings have changed,&rdquo; Robert said, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Ellen said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have come to prefer some one else,&rdquo; said
Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer no one before my own, before all these poor people
who are a part of my life,&rdquo; Ellen cried out, suddenly, her face
flaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you refuse to let me act for their final good?
You must know what it means to have them thrown out of work in
midwinter. You know the factory will remain closed for the present on
account of the strike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not doubt it,&rdquo; said Ellen, in a hard voice. All
the bitter thoughts to which she would not give utterance were in her
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot continue to run the factory at the present rate
and meet expenses,&rdquo; said Robert; &ldquo;in fact, I have been
steadily losing for the last month.&rdquo;  He had, after all,
descended to explanation. &ldquo;It amounts to my either reducing the
wage-list or closing the factory altogether,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;For my own good I ought to close the factory altogether, but I
thought I would give the men a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert thought by saying that he must have finally settled
matters. It did not enter his head that she would really think it
advisable for him to continue losing money. The pure childishness of
her attitude was something really beyond the comprehension of a man
of business who had come into hard business theories along with his
uncle's dollars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if you do lose money?&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>Robert stared at her. &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if you do lose money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man cannot conduct business on such principles,&rdquo;
replied Robert. &ldquo;There would soon be no business to conduct.
You don't understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do understand fully,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>Robert looked at her, at the clear, rosy curve of her young cheek,
the toss of yellow hair above a forehead as candid as a baby's, at
her little, delicate figure, and all at once such a rage of masculine
insistence over all this obstinacy of reasoning was upon him that it
was all he could do to keep himself from seizing her in his arms and
forcing her to a view of his own horizon. He felt himself drawn up in
opposition to an opponent at once too delicate, too unreasoning, and
too beloved to encounter. It seemed as if the absurdity of it would
drive him mad, and yet he was held to it. He tried to give a
desperate wrench aside from the main point of the situation. He
leaned over Ellen, so closely that his lips touched her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, let us leave all this,&rdquo; he pleaded; &ldquo;let
me talk to you. I had to wait a little while. I knew you would
understand that, but let me talk to you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen sat as rigid as marble. &ldquo;I wish to talk of nothing
besides the matter at hand, Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;That
is too close to my heart for any personal consideration to come
between.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LIV</h3>

<p>When Robert went home in the winter twilight he was more miserable
than he had ever been in his life. He felt as if he had been
assaulting a beautiful alabaster wall of unreason. He felt as if that
which he could shatter at a blow had yet held him in defiance. The
idea of this girl, of whom he had thought as his future wife,
deliberately setting herself against him, galled him inexpressibly,
and in spite of himself he could not quite free his mind of jealousy.
On his way home he stopped at Lyman Risley's office, and found, to
his great satisfaction, that he was alone, writing at his desk. Even
his stenographer had gone home. He turned around when Robert entered,
and looked at him with his quizzical, yet kindly, smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how are you, boy?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Robert dropped into the first chair, and sat therein, haunched up
as in a lapse of despair and weariness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Risley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard about the trouble in the factory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer Risley held up a night's paper with glaring
head-lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course it is in the papers,&rdquo; assented Robert,
wearily.</p>

<p>Risley stared at him in a lazily puzzled fashion.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is it all about? Why are you
so broken up about it?&rdquo;  Risley laid considerable emphasis on
the <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Robert, in a sudden stress of
indignation. &ldquo;You look at it like all the rest. Why are all the
laborers to be petted and coddled, and the capitalists held up to
execration? Good Lord, isn't there any pity for the rich man without
his drop of water, in the Bible or out? Are all creation born with
blinders on, and can they only see before their noses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, Robert?&rdquo; said Risley,
laughing a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say why should all the sympathy go to the workmen who are
acting like the pig-headed idiots they are, and none for the head of
the factory, who has the sharp-edged, red-hot brunt of it all to
bear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn't look at it that way if you were one of the
poor men just out on strike such weather as this,&rdquo; said Risley,
dryly. He glanced as he spoke at the window, which was beginning to
be thickly furred with frost in spite of the heat of the office.
Robert followed his gaze, and noted the spreading fairy jungle of
crystalline trees and flowers on the broad field of glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that is the worst thing in the world to
bear?&rdquo; he demanded, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Cold and hunger not only for yourself, but for those
you love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it is pretty bad,&rdquo; replied Risley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you had to bear that, at least for those you
loved, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; said the young man, lamely.</p>

<p>Risley remained silent, waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had been my uncle instead of myself I should simply
have shut down with no ado,&rdquo; said Robert, presently, in an
angry, argumentative voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you would; and as it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it was, I thought I would give them a chance. Good God,
Risley, I have been running the factory at a loss for a month as it
is. With this new wage-list I should no more than make expenses, if I
did that. What was it to me? I did it to keep them in some sort of
work. As for myself, I would much rather have shut down and done with
it, but I tried to keep it running on their account, poor devils, and
now I am execrated for it, and they have deliberately refused what
little I could offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you explain all this to the committee?&rdquo; asked
Risley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain? No! I told them my course was founded upon strict
business principles, and was as much for their good as for mine. They
understood. They know how hard the times are. Why, it was only last
week that Weeks &amp; McLaughlin failed, and that meant a heavy loss.
I didn't explain.&rdquo;  Then Robert hesitated and colored. &ldquo;I
have just explained to her,&rdquo; he said, with a curious hang of
his head, like a boy, &ldquo;and if my explanation was met in the
same fashion by the others in the factory I might as well have
addressed the north wind. They are all alike; they are a different
race. We cannot help them, and they cannot help themselves, because
they are themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean by her, Ellen Brewster?&rdquo; Risley said.</p>

<p>Robert nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all in the paper,&rdquo; said
Risley&mdash;&ldquo;what she said to the men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert made an impatient move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever there was a purely normal outgrowth, a perfect
flower of her birth and environments and training, that girl is
one,&rdquo; said Risley, with an accent of admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is infected with the ranting idiocy of those with whom
she has been brought in daily contact,&rdquo; said Robert; but even
as he spoke he seemed to see the girl's dear young face, and his
voice faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even as you may be infected with the conservatism of those
with whom you are brought in contact,&rdquo; said Risley, dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a democrat you are, Risley!&rdquo; said Robert,
impatiently. &ldquo;I believe you would make a good walking
delegate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Risley laughed. &ldquo;I think I would myself,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Wouldn't she listen to you, Robert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She listened with such utter dissent that she might as well
have been dumb. It is all over between us, Risley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How precipitate you are, you young folks!&rdquo; said the
other, good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How precipitate? Do you mean to say&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that you are forever thinking you are on the brink
of nothingness, when the true horizon-line is too far for you ever to
reach in your mortal life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in this case,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know nothing about it. But if you will excuse me, it
seems to me that the matter of all these people being reduced to
starvation in a howling winter is of more importance than the coming
together of two people in the bonds of wedlock. It is the aggregate
against the individual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't deny that,&rdquo; said Robert, doggedly, &ldquo;but
I am not responsible for the starvation, and the aggregate have
brought it on themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have shut down finally?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. I would rather shut down than not, as far as I
am concerned. It is distinctly for my interest. The only one
objection is losing experienced workmen, but in a community like
this, and in times like this, that objection is reduced to a minimum.
I can hire all I want in the spring if I wish to open again. I should
run a risk of losing on every order I should have to fill in the next
three months, even with the reduced list. I would rather shut down
than not; I only reduced the wages for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert rose as he spoke. He felt in his heart that he had gotten
scant sympathy and comfort. The older man looked with pity at the
young fellow's handsome, gloomy face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's one thing to remember,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the troubles of this world are born with wings.&rdquo;
Risley laughed, as he spoke, in his half-cynical fashion.</p>

<p>As Robert walked home&mdash;for there was no car due&mdash;he felt
completely desolate. It seemed to him that everybody was in league
against him. When he reached his uncle's splendid house and entered,
he felt such an isolation from his kind in the midst of his wealth
that something like an actual terror of solitude came over him.</p>

<p>The impecunious cousin of his aunt's who had come to her during
her last illness acted as his housekeeper. There was something
inexpressibly irritating about this woman, who had suffered so much,
and was now nestling, with a sense of triumph over the passing of her
griefs, in a luxurious home.</p>

<p>She asked Robert if it were true that the factory was closed, and
he felt that she noted his gloomy face, and realized a greater extent
of comfort from her own exemption from such questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business must be a great care,&rdquo; said she, and a look
of utter peaceful reflection upon her own lot overspread her
face.</p>

<p>After supper Robert went down to his aunt Cynthia's. He had not
been there for a long time. The minute he entered she started up with
an eagerness which had been completely foreign to her of late
years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Robert?&rdquo; she asked, softly. She
took both his hands as she spoke, and her look in his face was full
of delicate caressing.</p>

<p>Robert succumbed at once to this feminine solicitude, of which he
had had lately so little. He felt as if he had relapsed into
childhood. A sense of injury which was exquisite, as it brought along
with it a sense of his demand upon love and sympathy, seized him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am worried beyond endurance, Aunt Cynthia,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the strike? I have read the night papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I tried to do what was right, even at a sacrifice to
myself, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia had read about Ellen, but she was a woman, and she said
nothing as to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried to do what was right,&rdquo; Robert said, fairly
broken down again.</p>

<p>Cynthia had seated herself, and Robert had taken a low foot-stool
at her side. It came over him as he did so that it had been a
favorite seat of his when a child. As for Cynthia, influenced by the
appealing to the vulnerable place of her nature, she put her slim
hands on her nephew's head, and actually seemed to feel his baby
curls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>Robert put both his arms around her and hid his face on her
shoulder, for love is a comforter, in whatever guise.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LV</h3>

<p>On the day after the strike Ellen went to McGuire's and to
Briggs's, the two other factories in Rowe, to see if she could obtain
a position; but she was not successful. McGuire had discharged some
of his employ&eacute;s, reducing his force to its smallest possible
limits, since he had fewer orders, and was trying in that way to
avert the necessity of a cut in wages, and a strike or shut-down.
McGuire's was essentially a union factory, as was Briggs's. Ellen
would have found in either case difficulty about obtaining
employment, because she did not belong to the union, if for no other
reason. At Briggs's she encountered the proprietor himself in the
office, and he dismissed her with a bluff, almost brutal,
peremptoriness which hurt her cruelly, although she held up her head
high as she left. Briggs turned to a foreman who was standing by
before she was well out of hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Briggs read about
that girl in the paper last night, and the strike wouldn't have been
on at Lloyd's if it hadn't been for her. I would as soon take a
lighted match into a powder-magazine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The foreman grinned. &ldquo;She's a pretty, mild-looking
thing,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;doesn't look as if she could say boo to
a goose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's all you can tell,&rdquo; returned Briggs.
&ldquo;Deliver me from a light-complexioned woman. They're all the
very devil. Mrs. Briggs says it's the same girl that read that
composition that made such a stir at the high-school exhibition.
She'd make more trouble in a factory than a dozen ordinary girls, and
just now, when everything is darned ticklish-looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; assented the foreman, &ldquo;and all the
more because she's good-looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what you call good-looking,&rdquo; returned
Briggs.</p>

<p>He had two daughters, built upon the same heavy lines as himself
and wife, and he adored them. Insensibly he regarded all more
delicate feminine beauty as a disparagement of theirs. As Briggs
spoke, the foreman seemed to see in the air before his eyes the faces
of the two Briggs girls, large and massive, and dull of hue, the
feminine counterpart of their father's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you're right,&rdquo; said he, evasively.
&ldquo;I suppose some might call her good-looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he glanced out of the window at Ellen's retreating
figure, moving away over the snow-path with an almost dancing motion
of youth and courage, though she was sorely hurt. The girl had
scarcely ever had a hard word said to her in her whole life, for she
had been in her humble place a petted darling. She had plenty of
courage to bear the hard words now, but they cut deeply into her
unseasoned heart.</p>

<p>Ellen went on past the factories to the main street of Rowe. She
had no idea of giving up her efforts to obtain employment. She said
to herself that she must have work. She thought of the stores, that
possibly she might obtain a chance to serve as a sales-girl in one of
them. She actually began at the end of the long street, and worked
her way through it, with her useless inquiries, facing proprietors
and superintendents, but with no success. There was not a vacancy in
more than one or two, and there they wished only experienced hands.
She found out that her factory record told against her. The moment
she admitted that she had worked in a factory the cold shoulder was
turned. The position of a shop-girl was so far below that of a
sales-lady that the effect upon the superintendent was almost as if
he had met an unworthy aspirant to a throne. He would smile
insultingly and incredulously, even as he regarded her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would find that our goods are too fine to handle after
leather. Have you tried all the shops?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Ellen gave that up, and started homeward. She paused once
as she came opposite an intelligence office. There was one course yet
open to her, but from that she shrank, not on her own account, but
she dared not&mdash;knowing what would be the sufferings of her
relatives should she do so&mdash;apply for a position as a
servant.</p>

<p>As for herself, strained as she was to her height of youthful
enthusiasm for a great cause, as she judged it to be, clamping her
feet to the topmost round of her ladder of difficulty, she would have
essayed any honest labor with no hesitation whatever. But she thought
of her father and mother and grandmother, and went on past the
intelligence office.</p>

<p>When she came to her old school-teacher's&mdash;Miss
Mitchell's&mdash;house, she paused and hesitated a moment, then she
went up the little path between the snow-banks to the front door, and
rang the bell. The door was opened before the echoes had died away.
Miss Mitchell had seen her coming, and hastened to open it. Miss
Mitchell had not been teaching school for some years, having retired
on a small competency of her savings. Her mortgage was paid, and
there was enough for herself and her mother to live upon, with
infinite care as to details of expenditure. Every postage-stamp and
car-fare had its important part in the school-teacher's system of
economy; but she was quite happy, and her large face wore an
expression of perfect peace and placidity.</p>

<p>She was a woman who was not tortured by any strong, ungratified
desires. Her allotment of the gifts of the gods quite satisfied
her.</p>

<p>When Ellen entered the rather stuffy sitting-room&mdash;for Miss
Mitchell and her mother were jealous of any breath of cold air after
the scanty fire was kindled&mdash;it was like entering into a stratum
of peace. It seemed quite removed from the turmoil of her own life.
The school-teacher's old mother sat in her rocker close to the stove,
stouter than ever, filling up her chair with those wandering curves
and vague outlines which only the over-fleshy human form can assume.
She looked as indefinite as a quivering jelly until one reached her
face. That wore a fixedness of amiability which accentuated the whole
like a high light. She had not seen Ellen for a long time, and she
greeted her with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart!&rdquo; said she, in her sweet, throaty,
husky voice. &ldquo;Go and get her some of them cookies, Fanny,
do.&rdquo;  The old woman's faculties were not in the least impaired,
although she was very old, neither had her hands lost their cunning,
for she still retained her skill in cookery, and prepared the simple
meals for herself and daughter, seated in a high chair at the kitchen
table to roll out pastry or the famous little cookies which Ellen
remembered along with her childhood.</p>

<p>There was something about these cookies which Miss Mitchell
presently brought to her in a pretty china plate, with a little,
fine-fringed napkin, which was like a morsel of solace to the girl.
With the first sweet crumble of the cake on her plate, she wished to
cry. Sometimes the rush of old, kindly, tender associations will
overcome one who is quite equal to the strain of present emergency.
But she did not cry; she ate her cookies, and confided to Miss
Mitchell and her mother her desire to obtain a position elsewhere,
since her factory-work had failed her. It had occurred to her that
possibly Miss Mitchell, who was on the school-board, might know of a
vacancy in a primary school for the coming spring term, and that she
might obtain it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know enough to teach a primary school,&rdquo;
Ellen said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you do, bless your heart,&rdquo; said old Mrs.
Mitchell. &ldquo;She knows enough to teach any kind of a school,
don't she, Fanny? You get her a school, dear, right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Miss Mitchell knew of no probable vacancy, since one young
woman who had expected to be married had postponed her marriage on
account of the strike in Lloyd's, and the consequent throwing out of
employment of her sweetheart. Then, also, Miss Mitchell owned with
hesitation, in response to Ellen's insistent question, that she
supposed that the fact that she had worked in a shop might in any
case interfere with her obtaining a position in a school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no sense in it, dear child, I know,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but it might be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I supposed so,&rdquo; replied Ellen, bitterly.
&ldquo;They would all say that a shop-girl had no right to try to
teach school. Well, I'm much obliged to you, Miss
Mitchell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Miss Mitchell asked,
anxiously, following her to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going to Mrs. Doty, to get some of the wrappers that
mother works on, until something else turns up,&rdquo; replied
Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems a pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen smiled bravely. &ldquo;Beggars mustn't be choosers,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;If we can only keep along, somehow, I don't
care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a vehement pound of a stick on the floor, for that was
the way the old woman in the sitting-room commanded attention. Miss
Mitchell opened the door on a crack, that she might not let in the
cold air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, mother?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get Ellen a school right away, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, mother; I'll do my best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get her the grammar-school you used to have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something about the imperative solicitude of the old
woman which comforted Ellen in spite of its futility as she went on
her way. The good-will of another human soul, even when it cannot be
resolved into active benefits, has undoubtedly a mighty force of its
own. Ellen, with the sweet of the cookies still lingering on her
tongue, and the sweet of the old woman's kindness in her soul, felt
refreshed as if by some subtle spiritual cake and wine. She even went
to the door of Mrs. Doty's house. Mrs. Doty was the woman who let out
wrappers to her impecunious neighbors with an undaunted heart. She
had no difficulty there. The demand for cheap wrappers was not on the
wane, even in the hard times. When Ellen reached her grandmother's
house, with a great parcel under her arm, Mrs. Zelotes opened her
side door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got there, Ellen Brewster?&rdquo; she called
out sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some wrappers,&rdquo; replied Ellen, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to work on wrappers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, grandma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door was shut with a loud report.</p>

<p>When Ellen entered the house and the sitting-room, her mother
looked up from a pink wrapper which she was finishing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some wrappers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I haven't finished the last lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are for me to make, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew got up and went out of the room. Fanny shut her mouth hard,
and drew her thread through with a jerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, in a second, &ldquo;take off your
things, and let me show you how to start on them. There's a little
knack about it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LVI</h3>

<p>That was a hard winter for Rowe. Aside from the financial stress,
the elements seemed to conspire against the people who were so
ill-prepared to meet their fury. It was the coldest winter which had
been known for years; coal was higher, and the poor people had less
coal to burn. Storm succeeded storm; then, when there came a warm
spell, there was an epidemic of the grippe, and doctors' bills to pay
and quinine to buy&mdash;and quinine was very dear.</p>

<p>The Brewsters managed to keep up the interest on the house
mortgage, but their living expenses were reduced to the smallest
possible amount. In those days there was no wood laid ready for
kindling in the parlor stove, since there was neither any wood to
spare nor expectation of Robert's calling. Ellen and her mother sat
in the dining-room, for even the sitting-room fire had been
abolished, and they heated the dining-room whenever the weather
admitted it from the kitchen stove, and worked on the wrappers for
their miserable pittance.</p>

<p>The repeated storms were in a way a boon to Andrew, since he got
many jobs clearing paths, and thus secured a trifle towards the daily
expenses.</p>

<p>In those days Mrs. Zelotes watched the butcher-cart anxiously when
it stopped before her son's house, and she knew just what a tiny bit
of meat was purchased, and how seldom. On the days when the cart
moved on without any consultation at the tail thereof, the old woman
would buy an extra portion, cook it, and carry some over to her
son's.</p>

<p>Times grew harder and harder. Few of the operatives who had struck
in Lloyd's succeeded in obtaining employment elsewhere, and most of
them joined the union to enable them to do so. There was actual
privation. One evening, when the strike was some six weeks old, Abby
Atkins came over in a pouring rain to see Ellen. There were a number
of men in the dining-room that night. Amos Lee and Frank Dixon were
among them. It was a singular thing that Andrew, taking, as he had
done, no active part in any rebellion against authority, should have
come to see his house the headquarters for the rallies of dissension.
Men seemed to come to Andrew Brewster's for the sake of bolstering
themselves up in their hard position of defiance against tremendous
odds, though he sat by and seldom said a word. As for Ellen, she and
her mother on these occasions sat out in the kitchen, sewing on the
endless seams of the endless wrappers. Sometimes it seemed to the
girl as if wrappers enough were being made to clothe not only the
present, but future generations of poor women. She seemed to see
whole armies of hopeless, overburdened women, all arrayed in these
slouching garments, crowding the foreground of the world.</p>

<p>That evening little Amabel, who had developed a painful desire to
make herself useful, having divined the altered state of the family
finances, was pulling out basting-threads, with a puckered little
face bent over her work. She was a very thin child, but there was an
incisive vitality in her, and somehow Fanny and Ellen contrived to
keep her prettily and comfortably clothed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got to do my duty by poor Eva's child, if I
starve,&rdquo; Fanny often said.</p>

<p>When the side door opened, Ellen and her mother thought it was
another man come to swell the company in the dining-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It beats all how men like to come and sit round and talk
over matters; for my part, I 'ain't got any time to talk; I've got to
work,&rdquo; remarked Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; rejoined Ellen. She looked curiously like
her mother that night, and spoke like her. In her heart she echoed
the sarcasm to the full. She despised those men for sitting hour
after hour in a store, or in the house of some congenial spirit, or
standing on a street corner, and talking&mdash;talking, she was sure,
to no purpose. As for herself, she had done what she thought right;
she had, as it were, cut short the thread of her happiness of life
for the sake of something undefined and rather vague, and yet as
mighty in its demands for her allegiance as God. And it was done, and
there was no use in talking about it. She had her wrappers to make.
However, she told herself, extenuatingly, &ldquo;Men can't sew, so
they can't work evenings. They are better off talking here than they
would be in the billiard-saloon.&rdquo;  Ellen, at that time of her
life, had a slight, unacknowledged feeling of superiority over men of
her own class. She regarded them very much as she regarded children,
with a sort of tolerant good-will and contempt. Now, suddenly, she
raised her head and listened. &ldquo;That isn't another man, it's a
woman&mdash;it's Abby,&rdquo; she said to her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn't come out in all this rain,&rdquo; replied
Fanny. As she spoke, a great, wind-driven wash of it came over the
windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said Ellen, and she jumped up and opened
the dining-room door.</p>

<p>Abby had entered, as was her custom, without knocking. She had
left her dripping umbrella in the entry, and her old hat was
flattened on to her head with wet, and several damp locks of her hair
straggled from under it and clung to her thin cheeks. She still held
up her wet skirts around her, as she had held them out-of-doors, but
she was gesticulating violently with her other hand. She was
repeating what she had said before. Ellen had heard her indistinctly
through the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean just what I say,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Get
up and go to work, if you are men! Stop hanging around stores and
corners, and talking about the tyranny of the rich, and go to work,
and make them pay you something for it, anyhow. This has been kept up
long enough. Get up and go to work, if you don't want those belonging
to you to starve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby caught sight of Ellen, pale and breathless, in the door, with
her mother looking over her shoulder, and she addressed her with
renewed violence. &ldquo;Come here, Ellen,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and put yourself on my side. We've got to give in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go away,&rdquo; cried little Amabel, in a shrill voice,
looking around Ellen's arm; but nobody paid any attention to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never will,&rdquo; returned Ellen, with a great flash,
but her voice trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've got to,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;I tell you there's
no other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll die before I give up,&rdquo; cried Lee, in a loud,
threatening voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm with ye,&rdquo; said Tom Peel.</p>

<p>Dixon and the young laster who sat beside him looked at each
other, but said nothing. Dixon wrinkled his forehead over his
pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you'd better go to work quick, before some that I know
of, who are enough sight better worth saving than you are,
starve,&rdquo; replied Abby, unshrinkingly. &ldquo;If I could I would
go to Lloyd's and open it on my own account to-morrow. I believe in
bravery, but nothing except fools and swine jump over
precipices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby passed through the room, sprinkling rain-drops from her
drenched skirts, and went into the kitchen with Ellen. Fanny cast an
angry glance at her, then a solicitous one at her dripping
garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abby Atkins, you haven't got any rubbers on,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbers!&rdquo; repeated Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just slip off those wet skirts, and Amabel will fetch
you down Ellen's old black petticoat and brown dress.
Amabel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Abby seated herself peremptorily before the kitchen stove and
extended one soaked little foot in its shabby boot. &ldquo;I'm past
thinking or caring about wet skirts,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Good
Lord, what do wet skirts matter? We can't make wrappers any longer.
We had to sell the sewing-machine yesterday to pay the rent or be
turned out, and we haven't got a thing to eat in the house except
potatoes and a little flour. We haven't had any meat for a week. Nice
fare for a man like poor father and a girl like Maria! We have come
down to the kitchen fire like you, but we can't keep it burning as
late as this. The rest went to bed an hour ago to keep warm. Maria
has got more cold. She did seem better one spell, but now she's worse
again. Our chamber is freezing cold, and we haven't had a fire in it
since the strike. John Sargent has ransacked every town within twenty
miles for work, but he can't get any, and his sick sister keeps
sending to him for money. He looks as if he was just about done, too.
He went off somewhere after supper. A great supper! He don't smoke a
pipe nowadays. Father don't get the medicine he ought to have, and
that cold spell he just about perished for a little whiskey. The
bedroom was like ice with no fire in the sitting-room, and he didn't
sleep warm. It's one awful thing after another happening. Did you
know Mamie Brady took laudanum last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good land!&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did. Ed Flynn has been playing fast and loose with
her for a long time, and she's none too well balanced, and when it
came to her not having enough to eat, and to keep her warm, and her
mother nagging at her all the time&mdash;you know what an awful hard
woman her mother is&mdash;she got desperate. She gulped it down when
the last car went past and Ed Flynn hadn't come; she had been
watchin' out for him; then she told her mother, and her mother shook
her, then run for Dr. Fox, and he called in Dr. Lord, and they worked
with a stomach-pump till morning, and she isn't out of danger yet.
Then that isn't all. Willy Jones's mother is failing. He was over to
our house last evening, telling us about it, and he fairly cried,
poor boy. He said he actually could not get her what she needed to
make her comfortable this awful winter. It was all he could do with
odd jobs to keep the roof over their heads, that she hadn't actually
enough to eat and keep her warm. It seemed as if he would die when he
told about it. And that isn't all. Those little Blake children next
door are fairly starving. They are going around to the neighbors'
swill-buckets&mdash;it's a fact&mdash;just like little hungry dogs,
and it's precious little they find in them. Mrs. Wetherhed has let
her sewing-machine go, and Edward Morse is going to be sold out for
taxes. And that isn't all.&rdquo;  Abby lowered her voice a little.
She cast an apprehensive glance at the door of the other room, and at
Amabel. &ldquo;Mamie Bemis has gone to the bad. I had it straight.
She's in Boston. She didn't have enough to pay for her board, and got
desperate. I know her sister did wrong, but that was no reason why
she should have, and I don't believe she would if it hadn't been for
the strike. It's all on account of the strike. There's no use
talking: before the sparrow flies in the eyes of the tiger, he'd
better count the cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny, quite white, stood staring from Abby to Ellen, and back
again.</p>

<p>Amabel was holding fast to a fold of Ellen's skirt. Ellen looked
rigid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it all before,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Suddenly Abby jumped up and caught the other girl in a fierce
embrace. &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; she sobbed&mdash;&ldquo;Ellen, isn't
there any way out of it? I can't see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen freed herself from Abby with a curious imperative yet gentle
motion, then she opened the door into the other room again. The loud
clash of voices hushed, and every man faced towards her standing on
the threshold, with her mother and Abby and little Amabel in the
background. &ldquo;I want to say to you all,&rdquo; said Ellen, in a
clear voice, &ldquo;that I think I did wrong. I have been wondering
if I had not for some time, and growing more and more certain. I did
not count the cost. All I thought of was the principle, but the cost
is a part of the principle in this world, and it has to be counted in
with it. I see now. I don't think the strike ought ever to have been.
It has brought about too much suffering upon those who were not
responsible for it, who did not choose it of their own free will.
There are children starving, and people dying and breaking their
hearts. We have brought too much upon ourselves and others. I am
sorry I said what I did in the shop that day, if I influenced any
one. Now I am not going to strike any longer. Let us all accept Mr.
Lloyd's terms, and go back to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen's voice was drowned out in a great shout of wrath and
dissent from Lee. He directly leaped to the conclusion that the girl
took this attitude on account of Lloyd, and his jealousy, which was
always smouldering, flamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess not!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I rather guess
not! I've struck, and I'm going to stay struck! I ain't goin' to back
out because a girl likes the boss, damn him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew and the young laster rose and moved quietly before Ellen.
Tom Peel said nothing, but he grinned imperturbably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'ain't had a bit of tobacco, and the less said about what
I've had to eat the better,&rdquo; Lee went on, in a loud,
threatening voice, &ldquo;but I ain't going to give up. No, miss;
you've het up the fightin' blood in me, and it ain't so easy coolin'
of it down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened, and Granville Joy entered. He had knocked several
times, but nobody had heard him. He looked inquiringly from one to
another, then moved beside Andrew and the laster.</p>

<p>Dixon got up. &ldquo;It looks to me as if it was too soon to be
giving up now,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's easy for a man who's got nobody dependent upon him to
talk,&rdquo; cried Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't give up!&rdquo; cried Dixon, looking straight at
Ellen, and ignoring Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Lee. &ldquo;We don't give up our
rights for bosses, or bosses' misses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said that there was a concerted movement of Andrew, the
laster, and Granville. Granville was much slighter than Lee, but
suddenly his right arm shot out, and the other man went down like a
log. Andrew followed him up with a kick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of my house,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;and never
set foot in it again! Out with ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lee was easily cowed. He did not attempt to make any resistance,
but gathered himself up, muttering, and moved before the three into
the entry, where he had left his coat and hat. Dixon and Peel
followed him. When the door was shut, Ellen turned to the others,
with a quieting hand on Amabel's head, who was clinging to her,
trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it will be best to talk to John Sargent,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;I think a committee had better be appointed to wait
upon Mr. Lloyd again, and ask him to open the factory. I'm not going
to strike any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sure I'm not,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abby and I are not going to strike any longer,&rdquo; said
Ellen, in an indescribably childlike way, which yet carried enormous
weight with it.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LVII</h3>

<p>Ellen had not arrived at her decision with regard to the strike as
suddenly as it may have seemed. All winter, ever since the strike,
Ellen had been wondering, not whether the principle of the matter was
correct or not, that she never doubted; she never swerved in her
belief concerning the cruel tyranny of the rich and the helpless
suffering of the poor, and their good reason for making a stand, but
she doubted more and more the wisdom of it. She used to sit for hours
up in her chamber after her father and mother had gone to bed,
wrapped up in an old shawl against the cold, resting her elbows on
the window-sill and her chin on her two hands, staring out into the
night, and reflecting. Her youthful enthusiasm carried her like a
leaping-pole to conclusions beyond her years. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;if, after all, this inequality of
possessions is not a part of the system of creation, if the righting
of them is not beyond the flaming sword of the Garden of Eden? I
wonder if the one who tries to right them forcibly is not meddling,
and usurping the part of the Creator, and bringing down wrath and
confusion not only upon his own head, but upon the heads of others? I
wonder if it is wise, in order to establish a principle, to make
those who have no voice in the matter suffer for it&mdash;the
helpless women and children?&rdquo;  She even thought with a sort of
scornful sympathy of Sadie Peel, who could not have her nearseal
cape, and had not wished to strike. She reflected, as she had done so
many times before, that the world was very old&mdash;thousands of
years old&mdash;and inequality was as old as the world. Might it not
even be a condition of its existence, the shifting of weights which
kept it to its path in the scheme of the universe? And yet always she
went back to her firm belief that the strikers were right, and
always, although she loved Robert Lloyd, she denounced him. Even when
it came to her abandoning her position with regard to the strike, she
had not the slightest thought of effecting thereby a reconciliation
with Robert.</p>

<p>For the first time, that night when she had gone to bed, after
announcing her determination to go back to work, she questioned her
affection for Robert. Before she had always admitted it to herself
with a sort of shamed and angry dignity. &ldquo;Other women feel so
about men, and why should I not?&rdquo; she had said; &ldquo;and I
shall never fail to keep the feeling behind more important
things.&rdquo;  She had accepted the fact of it with childlike
straightforwardness as she accepted all other facts of life, and now
she wondered if she really did care for him so much. She thought over
and over everything Abby had said, and saw plainly before her mental
vision those poor women parting with their cherished possessions, the
little starving children snatching at the refuse-buckets at the
neighbors' back doors. She saw with incredulous shame, and something
between pity and scorn, Mamie Bemis, who had gone wrong, and Mamie
Brady, who had taken her foolish, ill-balanced life in her own hands.
She remembered every word which she had said to the men on the
morning of the strike, and how they had started up and left their
machines. &ldquo;I did it all,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I am
responsible for it all&mdash;all this suffering, for those hungry
little children, for that possible death, for the ruin of another
girl.&rdquo;  Then she told herself, with a stern sense of justice,
that back of her responsibility came Robert Lloyd's. If he had not
cut the wages it would never have been. It seemed to her that she
almost hated him, and that she could not wait to strive to undo the
harm which she had done. She could not wait for morning to come.</p>

<p>She lay awake all night in a fever of impatience. When she went
down-stairs her eyes were brilliant, there were red spots on her
cheeks, her lips were tense, her whole face looked as if she were
strained for some leap of action. She took hold of everything she
touched with a hard grip. Her father and mother kept watching her
anxiously. Directly after breakfast Ellen put on her hat and
coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going over to see John Sargent, and ask him to get
some other men and go to see Mr. Lloyd, and tell him we are willing
to go to work again,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>Ellen discovered, when she reached the Atkins house, that John
Sargent had already resolved upon his course of action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first thing he said when he came in last night was that
he couldn't stand it any longer, and he was going to see the others,
and go to Lloyd, and ask him to open the shop on his own
terms,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;I told him how we felt about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am ready to go back whenever the factory is
opened,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;I am glad he has gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen did not remain long. She was anxious to return and finish
some wrappers she had on hand. Abby promised to go over and let her
know the result of the interview with Lloyd.</p>

<p>It was not until evening that Abby came over, and John Sargent
with her. Lloyd had not been at home in the morning, and they had
been forced to wait until late afternoon. The two entered the
dining-room, where Ellen and her mother sat at work.</p>

<p>Abby spoke at once, and to the point. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;the shop's going to be opened to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what terms?&rdquo; asked Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the boss's, of course,&rdquo; replied Abby, in a hard
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's the only thing to do,&rdquo; said Sargent, with a sort
of stolid assertion. &ldquo;If we are willing to be crushed under the
Juggernaut of principle, we haven't any right to force others under,
and that's what we are doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bread without butter is better than no bread at all,&rdquo;
said Abby. &ldquo;We've got to live in the sphere in which Providence
has placed us.&rdquo;  The girl said &ldquo;Providence&rdquo; with a
sarcastic emphasis.</p>

<p>Andrew was looking at Sargent. &ldquo;Do you think there will be
any trouble?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Sargent hesitated, with a glance at Fanny. &ldquo;I don't know; I
hope not,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Lee and Dixon are opposed to giving
in, and they are talking hard to-night in the store. Then some of the
men have joined the union since the strike, and of course they swear
by it, because it has been helping them, and they won't approve of
giving up. But I doubt if there will be much trouble. I guess the
majority want to go to work, even the union men. The amount of it is,
it has been such a tough winter it has taken the spirit out of the
poor souls.&rdquo;  Sargent, evidently, in yielding was resisting
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't think there will be any danger?&rdquo; Fanny
said, anxiously, looking at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, there's no danger for the girls, anyhow. I guess
there's enough men to look out for them. There's no need for you to
worry, Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lloyd did not offer to do anything better about the
wages?&rdquo; asked Ellen.</p>

<p>Sargent shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch him!&rdquo; said Abby, bitterly.</p>

<p>Ellen had a feeling as if she were smiting in the face that image
of Robert which always dwelt in her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Abby, with a mirthless laugh,
&ldquo;there's one thing: according to the Scriptures, it is as hard
for the rich man to get into heaven as it is for the poor men to get
into their factories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't suppose there will be any danger?&rdquo; Fanny
said again, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Danger&mdash;no; who's afraid of Amos Lee and a few like
him?&rdquo; cried Abby, contemptuously; &ldquo;and Nahum Beals is
safe. He's going to be tried next month, they say, but they'll make
it imprisonment for life, because they think he wasn't in his right
mind. If he was here we might be afraid, but there's nobody now that
will do anything but talk. I ain't afraid. I'm going to march up to
the shop to-morrow morning and go to work, and I'd like to see
anybody stop me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, before they left, John Sargent spoke aside with Andrew,
and told him of a plan for the returning workmen to meet at the
corner of a certain street, and go in a body to the factory, and
suggested that there might be pickets posted by the union men, and
Andrew resolved to go with Ellen.</p>

<p>The next morning the rain had quite ceased, and there was a faint
something, rather a reminiscence than a suggestion, of early spring
in the air. People caught themselves looking hard at the elm branches
to see if they were acquiring the virile fringe of spring or if their
eyes deceived them, and wondered, with respect to the tips of maple
and horse-chestnut branches, whether or not they were swollen red and
glossy. Sometimes they sniffed incredulously when a soft gust of
south wind seemed laden with fresh blossom fragrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare, if I didn't know better, I should think I
smelled apple blossoms,&rdquo; said Maria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff!&rdquo; returned Abby. She was marching along with an
alert, springy motion of her lean little body. She was keenly alive
to the situation, and scented something besides apple blossoms. She
had tried to induce Maria to remain at home. &ldquo;I don't know but
there'll be trouble, and if there is, you'll be just in the
way,&rdquo; she told her before they left the house, but not in their
parents' hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't believe there'll be any. Folks will be too glad
to get back to work,&rdquo; replied Maria. She had a vein of
obstinacy, gentle as she was; then, too, she had a reason which no
one suspected for wishing to be present. She would not yield when
John Sargent begged her privately not to go. It was just because she
was afraid there might be trouble, and he was going to be in it, that
she could not bear to stay at home herself.</p>

<p>Andrew had insisted upon accompanying Ellen in spite of her
remonstrances. &ldquo;I've got an errand down to the store,&rdquo; he
said, evasively; but Ellen understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think there is any danger, and there wouldn't be
any danger for me&mdash;not for the girls, sure,&rdquo; she said; but
he persisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you say a word to your mother to scare her,&rdquo; he
whispered. But they had not been gone long before Fanny followed
them, Mrs. Zelotes watching her furtively from a window as she went
by.</p>

<p>All the returning employ&eacute;s met, as agreed upon, at the
corner of a certain street, and marched in a solid body towards
Lloyd's. The men insisted upon placing the girls in the centre of
this body, although some of them rebelled, notably Sadie Peel. She
was on hand, laughing and defiant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I ain't afraid,&rdquo; she proclaimed.
&ldquo;Father's keepin' on strikin', but I guess he won't see his own
daughter hurt; and now I'm goin' to have my nearseal cape, if it is
late in the season. They're cheaper now, that's one good thing. On
some accounts the strike has been a lucky thing for me.&rdquo;  She
marched along, swinging her arms jauntily. Ellen and Maria and Abby
were close together. Andrew was on the right of Ellen, Granville Joy
behind; the young laster, who had called so frequently evenings, was
with him. John Sargent and Willy Jones were on the left. They all
walked in the middle of the street like an army. It was covertly
understood that there might be trouble. Some of the younger men from
time to time put hands on their pockets, and a number carried stout
sticks.</p>

<p>The first intimation of disturbance came when they met an
electric-car, and all moved to one side to let it pass. The car was
quite full of people going to another town, some thirty miles
distant, to work in a large factory there. Nearly every man and woman
on the car belonged to the union.</p>

<p>As this car slid past a great yell went up from the occupants; men
on the platforms swung their arms in execration and derision.
&ldquo;Sc-ab, sc-ab!&rdquo; they called. A young fellow leaped from
the rear platform, caught up a stone and flung it at the returning
Lloyd men, but it went wide of its mark. Then he was back on the
platform with a running jump, and one of the Lloyd men threw a stone,
which missed him. The yell of &ldquo;Scab, scab!&rdquo; went up with
renewed vigor, until it died out of hearing along with the rumble of
the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I wish I had joined the union and stuck it
out,&rdquo; said one of the Lloyd men, gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the Lord's sake, don't show the white feather
now!&rdquo; cried a young fellow beside him, who was striding on with
an eager, even joyous outlook. He had fighting blood, and it was up,
and he took a keen delight in the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's easy to talk,&rdquo; grumbled the other man. &ldquo;I
don't know but all our help lies in the union, and we've been a pack
of fools not to go in with them, because we hoped Lloyd would weaken
and take us back. He hasn't weakened; we've had to. Good God, them
that's rich have it their own way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd have joined the union in a minute, and got a job, and
got my nearseal cape, if it hadn't been for father,&rdquo; said Sadie
Peel, with a loud laugh. &ldquo;But, my land! if father'd caught me
joinin' the union I dun'no' as there would have been anything left of
me to wear the cape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all marched along with no disturbance until they reached the
corner of the street into which they had to turn in order to approach
Lloyd's. There they were confronted by a line of pickets, stationed
there by the union, and the real trouble began. Yells of &ldquo;Scab,
scab!&rdquo; filled the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good land, I ain't no more of a scab than you be!&rdquo;
shrieked Sadie Peel, in a loud, angry voice. &ldquo;Scab yourself!
Touch me if you dasse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many young men among the returning force had stout sticks in their
hands. Granville Joy was one of them. Andrew, who was quite unarmed,
pressed in before Ellen. Granville caught him by the arm and tried to
draw him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Brewster,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you keep in
the background a little. I am young and strong, and here are Sargent
and Mendon. You'd better keep back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen, with a spring which was effectual because so utterly
uncalculated, was before Granville and her father, and them all. She
reasoned it out in a second that she was responsible for the strike,
and that she would be in the front of whatever danger there was in
consequence. Her slight little figure passed them all before they
knew what she was doing. She was in the very front of the little
returning army. She saw the threatening faces of the pickets; she
half turned, and waved an arm of encouragement, like a general in a
battle. &ldquo;Strike if you want to,&rdquo; she cried out, in her
sweet young voice. &ldquo;If you want to kill a girl for going back
to work to save herself and her friends from starvation, do it. I am
not afraid! But kill me, if you must kill anybody, because I am the
one that started the strike. Strike if you want to.&rdquo;</p>

alt="If you want to kill a girl for going back to work to save herself from starvation, do it!"></a>
</div>

<p>The opposing force moved aside with an almost imperceptible
motion. Ellen looked like a beautiful child, her light hair tossed
around her rosy face, her eyes full of the daring of perfect
confidence. She in reality did not feel one throb of fear. She passed
the picket-line, and turned instinctively and marched backward with
her blue eyes upon them all. Abby Atkins sprang forward to Ellen's
side, with Sargent and Joy and Willy Jones and Andrew. Andrew kept
calling to Ellen to come back, but she did not heed him.</p>

<p>The little army was several rods from the pickets before a shot
rang out, but that was fired into the air. However, it was followed
by a fierce clamor of &ldquo;Scab&rdquo; and a shower of stones,
which did little harm. The Lloyds marched on without a word, except
from Sadie Peel. She turned round with a derisive shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scab yourselves!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;You dassen't
fire at me. You're scabs yourselves, you be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scabs, scabs!&rdquo; shouted the men, moving forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scab yourself!&rdquo; shouted Sadie Peel.</p>

<p>Abby Atkins caught hold of her arm and shook her violently.
&ldquo;Shut up, can't you, Sadie Peel,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll shut up when I get ready, Abby Atkins! I ain't afraid
of them if you be. They dassen't hit me. Scab, scab!&rdquo; the girl
yelled back, with a hysteric laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't that girl know anything?&rdquo; growled a man behind
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Sadie Peel,&rdquo; said Abby Atkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't afraid if you be, and I won't shut up till I get
ready, for you or anybody else. I'm goin' to have my nearseal cape!
Hi!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't afraid,&rdquo; said Abby, contemptuously,
&ldquo;but I've got sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maria pressed close to Sadie Peel. &ldquo;Please do keep still,
Sadie,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Let us get into the factory as
quietly as we can. Think, if anybody was hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't afraid,&rdquo; shrieked the girl, with a toss of
her red fringe, and she laughed like a parrot. Abby Atkins gripped
her arm so fiercely that she made her cry out with pain. &ldquo;If
you don't keep still!&rdquo; she said, threateningly.</p>

<p>Willy Jones was walking as near as he could, and he carried his
right arm half extended, as if to guard her. Now and then Abby turned
and gave him a push backward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won't trouble us girls, and you might as well let us
and the men that have sticks go first,&rdquo; she said in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think&mdash;&rdquo; began the young fellow,
coloring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you ain't afraid,&rdquo; said Abby, &ldquo;but
you've got your mother to think of, and there's no use in running
into danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pickets were gradually left behind; they were, in truth,
half-hearted. Many of them had worked in Lloyd's, and had small mind
to injure their old comrades. They were not averse to a great show of
indignation and bluster, but when it came to more they hesitated.</p>

<p>Presently the company came into the open space before Lloyd's.
Robert and Lyman Risley and several foremen were standing at the foot
of the stairs. The windows of the factory were filled with faces, and
derisive cries came from them. Lloyd's tall shaft of chimney was
plumed with smoke. The employ&eacute;s advanced towards the stairs,
when suddenly Amos Lee, Dixon, and a dozen others appeared, coming
with a rush from around a corner of the building, and again the air
was filled with the cry of &ldquo;Scab!&rdquo;  Ellen and Abby linked
arms and sprang forward before the men with an impetuous rush, with
Joy and Willy Jones and Andrew following. Ellen, as she rushed on
towards the factory stairs, was conscious of no fear at all, but
rather of a sort of exaltation of courage. It did not really occur to
her that she could be hurt, that it could be in the heart of Lee or
Dixon, or any of them, actually to harm her. She was throbbing and
intense with indignation and resolution. Into that factory to her
work she was bound to go. All that intimidated her in the least was
the fear for her father. She rushed as fast as she could that her
father might not get before her and be hurt in some way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scab! scab!&rdquo; shouted Lee and the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scab yourself!&rdquo; shrieked Sadie Peel. Her father was
one of the opposing party, and that gave her perfect audacity.
&ldquo;Look out you don't hit me, dad,&rdquo; she cried to him.
&ldquo;I'm goin' to get my nearseal cape. Don't you hit your
daughter, Tom Peel!&rdquo;  She raced on with a sort of hoppity-skip.
She caught a young man near her by the arm and forced him into the
same dancing motion.</p>

<p>They were at the foot of the stairs, when Robert, watching, saw
Lee with a pistol in his hand aim straight at Ellen. He sprang before
her, but Risley was nearer, and the shot struck him. When Risley
fell, a great cry, it would have been difficult to tell whether of
triumph or horror, went up from the open windows of the other
factories, and men came swarming out. Lee and his companions
vanished.</p>

<p>A great crowd gathered around Risley until the doctors came and
ordered them away, and carried him in the ambulance to the hospital.
He was not dead, but evidently very seriously injured.</p>

<p>When the ambulance had rolled out of sight, the Lloyd
employ&eacute;s entered the factory, and the hum of machinery
began.</p>

<p>Fanny and Andrew stood together before the factory after Ellen had
entered. Andrew had started when he had seen his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You here?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather guess I'm here,&rdquo; returned Fanny. &ldquo;Do
you s'pose I was goin' to stay at home, and not know whether you and
her were shot dead or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it's all safe now,&rdquo; said Andrew. He was very
pale. He looked at the blood-stained place where Lyman Risley had
lain. &ldquo;It's awful work,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; asked Fanny, sharply. &ldquo;I heard the
shot just before I got here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know for sure, and guess it's better I
don't,&rdquo; replied Andrew, sternly.</p>

<p>Then all at once as they stood there a woman came up with a swift,
gliding motion and a long trail of black skirts straight to Fanny,
who was the only woman there. There were still a great many men and
boys standing about. The woman, Cynthia Lennox, caught Fanny's arm
with a nervous grip. Her finely cut face was very white under the
nodding plumes of her black bonnet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in there?&rdquo; she asked, in a strained voice,
pointing to the shop.</p>

<p>Fanny stared at her. She was half dazed. She did not know whether
she was referring to the wounded man or Robert.</p>

<p>Andrew was quicker in his perceptions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They carried him off to the hospital in the
ambulance,&rdquo; he told her. Then he added, as gently as if he had
been addressing Ellen: &ldquo;I guess he wasn't hurt so very bad. He
came to before they took him away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't know anything about it,&rdquo; Fanny said,
sharply. &ldquo;I heard them say something about his eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His eyes!&rdquo; gasped Cynthia. She held tightly to Fanny,
who looked at her with a sudden passion of sympathy breaking through
her curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he wasn't hurt so very bad; he <em>did</em>
come to. I heard him speak,&rdquo; she said, soothingly. She laid her
hard hand over Cynthia's slim one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They took him to the hospital?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in the ambulance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;my nephew in there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he went with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cynthia looked at the other woman with an expression of utter
anguish and pleading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;the hospital ain't
very far from here. Suppose we go up there and ask how he is? We
could call out your nephew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go with me?&rdquo; asked Cynthia, with a
heart-breaking gasp.</p>

<p>If Ellen could have seen her at that moment, she would have
recognized her as the woman whom she had known in her childhood. She
was an utter surprise to Fanny, but her sympathy leaped to meet her
need like the steel to the magnet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; she said, heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said Andrew&mdash;&ldquo;I would go with
her, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;and you had
better go home, I guess, Andrew, and see how I left the kitchen fire.
I don't know but the dampers are all wide open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny and Cynthia hastened in one direction towards the hospital,
and Andrew towards home; but he paused for a minute, and looked
thoughtfully up at the humming pile of Lloyd's. The battle was over
and the strike was ended. He drew a great sigh, and went home to see
to the kitchen fire.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LVIII</h3>

<p>Lyman Risley was very seriously injured. There was, as the men had
reported, danger for his eyes. When Robert was called into the
reception-room of the hospital to see his aunt, he scarcely
recognized her. Her soft, white hair was tossed about her temples,
her cheeks were burning. She ran up to him like an eager child and
clutched his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Tell me
quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are doing everything they can for him. Why, don't,
poor Aunt Cynthia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His eyes, they said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he will come out all right. Don't, dear Aunt
Cynthia.&rdquo;  The young man put his arm around his aunt and spoke
soothingly, blushing like a girl before this sudden revelation of an
under-stratum of delicacy in a woman's heart.</p>

<p>Cynthia lost control of herself completely; or, rather, the true
self of her rose uppermost, shattering the surface ice of her
reserve. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;oh, if he&mdash;if
he is&mdash;blind, if he is&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;will lead him
everywhere all the rest of his life; I will, Robert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will, dear Aunt Cynthia,&rdquo; replied
Robert, soothingly.</p>

<p>Suddenly Cynthia's face took on a new expression. She looked at
Robert, deadly pale, and her jaw dropped. &ldquo;He will
not&mdash;die,&rdquo; she said, with stiff lips. &ldquo;It is not as
bad as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no; I am sure he will not,&rdquo; Robert cried,
wonderingly and pityingly. &ldquo;Don't, Aunt Cynthia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he dies,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;if he
dies&mdash;and he has loved me all this time, and I have never done
anything for him&mdash;I cannot bear it; I will not bear it; I will
not, Robert!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he isn't going to die, Aunt Cynthia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go to him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
<em>will</em> go to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert looked helplessly from her to Fanny. &ldquo;I am afraid you
can't just now, Aunt Cynthia,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>Fanny came resolutely to his assistance. &ldquo;Of course you
can't, Miss Lennox,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The doctors won't let you
see him now. You would do him more harm than good. You don't want to
do him harm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't want to do him harm,&rdquo; returned Cynthia,
in a wailing, hysterical voice. She threw herself down upon a sofa
and began sobbing like a child, with her face hidden.</p>

<p>A young doctor entered and stood looking at her.</p>

<p>Robert turned to him. &ldquo;It is my aunt, and she is agitated
over Mr. Risley's accident,&rdquo; he said, coloring a little.</p>

<p>Instantly the young physician's face lost its expression of
astonishment and assumed the soothing gloss of his profession.
&ldquo;Oh, my dear Miss Lennox,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no
cause for agitation, I assure you. Everything is being done for Mr.
Risley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he be blind?&rdquo; gasped Cynthia, with a great
vehemence of woe, which seemed to gainsay the fact of her years. It
seemed as if such an outburst of emotion could come only from a child
all unacquainted with grief and unable to control it.</p>

<p>The young doctor laughed blandly. &ldquo;Blind? No, indeed,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;He might have been blind had this happened
twenty-five years ago, but with the resources of the present day it
is a different matter. Pray don't alarm yourself, dear Miss
Lennox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you call a carriage for my aunt?&rdquo; asked Robert.
He went close to Cynthia and laid a hand on her slender shoulder.
&ldquo;I am going to have a carriage come for you, and perhaps Mrs.
Brewster will be willing to go home with you in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; replied Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear what Dr. Payson says, that there is nothing to be
alarmed about,&rdquo; Robert said, in a low voice, with his lips
close to his aunt's ear.</p>

<p>Cynthia made no resistance, but when the carriage arrived, and she
was being driven off, with Fanny by her side, she called out of the
window with a fierce shamelessness of anxiety, &ldquo;Robert, you
must come and tell me how he is this afternoon, or I shall come back
here and see him myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will, Aunt Cynthia,&rdquo; he replied, soothingly.
He met the doctor's curious eyes when he turned. The young man had a
gossiping mind, but he forbore to say what he thought, which was to
the effect that&mdash;why under the heavens, if that woman cared as
much as that for that man, she had not married him, instead of
letting him dangle after her so many years? But he merely said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no use in saying anything to excite a woman
further when she is in such a state of mind, but&mdash;&rdquo;  Then
he paused significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think the chances of his keeping his eyesight are
poor?&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mighty poor,&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>

<p>Robert stood still, with his pale, shocked face bent upon the
carpet. He could not seem to comprehend at once the enormity of it
all; his mind was grasping at and trying to assimilate the horrible
fact with an infinite pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they got the man that did it?&rdquo; asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know. I had to see to poor Risley,&rdquo; replied
Robert. &ldquo;I hope to God they have.&rdquo;  Then all at once he
thought, with keen anxiety, of Ellen. Who knew what new tragedy had
happened? &ldquo;I must go back to the factory,&rdquo; he said,
hurriedly. &ldquo;I will be back here in an hour or so, and see how
he is getting on. For Heaven's sake, do all you can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert was desperately impatient to be back at the factory. He was
full of vague anxiety about Ellen. He could not forget that the shot
which had hit poor Risley had been meant for her, and he remembered
the look on the man's face as he aimed. He found a carriage at the
street corner, and jumped in, and bade the man drive fast.</p>

<p>When Robert entered the great building, and felt the old vibration
of machinery, he had a curious sensation, one which he had never
before had and which he had not expected. For the first time in his
life he knew what it was to have a complete triumph of his own will
over his fellow-men. He had gotten his own way. All this army of
workmen, all this machinery of labor, was set in motion at his
desire, in opposition to their own. He realized himself a leader and
a conqueror. He went into the office, and Flynn and Dennison came
forward, smiling, to greet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dennison, &ldquo;we're off again.&rdquo;
He spoke as if the factory were a ship which had been launched from a
shoal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Robert, gravely.</p>

<p>Nellie Stone, at the desk, was glancing around, with a half-shy,
half-coquettish look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Mr. Risley?&rdquo; asked Flynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is badly hurt,&rdquo; replied Robert. &ldquo;Have they
found the man? Do you know what has been done about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They've got all the police force of the city out,&rdquo;
replied Flynn, &ldquo;but it's no use. They'll never catch Amos Lee.
His mother was a gypsy, I've always heard. He knows about a thousand
ways out of traps, and there's plenty to help him. They've got Dixon
under arrest, and Tom Peel; but they didn't have any fire-arms on
'em, and they can't prove anything. Peel says he's ready to go back
to work.&rdquo;  Flynn had a somewhat seedy and downcast appearance,
although he fought hard for his old jaunty manner. His impulsive
good-nature had gotten the better of his judgment and his own wishes,
and he had gone to Mamie Brady and offered to marry her out of hand
if she recovered from her attempted suicide. The night before he had
watched, turn and turn about, with her mother. He gave a curious
effect of shamefaced and melancholy virtue. He followed Robert to one
side when he was hanging up his hat and coat. &ldquo;I'm going to
tell you, Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; he said, rather awkwardly; &ldquo;maybe
you won't be interested in the midst of all this, but it all came
from the strike. She's better this morning, and I'm going to marry
her, poor girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert looked at him in a dazed fashion. For a moment he had not
the slightest idea what he was talking about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going to marry Mamie Brady,&rdquo; explained Flynn.
&ldquo;She took laudanum. It all happened on account of the strike.
I'll own I'd been flirting some with her, but she'd never done it if
she hadn't been out of work, too. She said so. Her mother made her
life a hell. I'm going to marry her, and take her out of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's mighty good of you,&rdquo; Robert said, rather
stupidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain't no other way for me to do,&rdquo; replied
Flynn. &ldquo;She thinks the world of me, and I suppose I'm to
blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope she'll make you a good wife and you'll be
happy,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thinks all creation of me,&rdquo; replied Flynn, with
the simplest vanity and acquiescence in the responsibility laid upon
him in the world. &ldquo;That shot wasn't meant for Mr.
Risley,&rdquo; said Flynn, as Robert approached the office door. His
eyes flashed. He himself would gladly have been shot for the sake of
Ellen Brewster. He was going to marry, and try to fulfill his simple
code of honor, but all his life he would be married to one woman,
with another ideal in his heart; that was inevitable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it wasn't,&rdquo; Robert replied, grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is quiet now,&rdquo; said Dennison, with his
smooth smile. Robert made no reply, but entered the great work-room.
&ldquo;He's mighty stand-offish, now he's got his own way,&rdquo;
Dennison remarked in a whisper to Nellie Stone. He leaned closely
over her. Flynn had followed Robert. The girl glanced up at the
foreman, who was unmarried, although years older than she, and her
face quivered a little, but it seemed due to a surface
sensitiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know if you've heard that Ed is going to marry
Mamie Brady, after all,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>Dennison nodded.</p>

<p>She knitted her forehead over a column of figures. Dennison leaned
his face so close that his blond-bearded cheek touched hers. She made
a little impatient motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, go long, Jim Dennison,&rdquo; she said, but her tone
was half-hearted.</p>

<p>Dennison persisted, bending her head gently backward until he
kissed her. She pushed him away, but she smiled weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn't want Ed Flynn. Why, he's a Roman Catholic, and
you're Baptist, Nell,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said I did?&rdquo; she retorted, angrily. &ldquo;Why, I
wouldn't marry Ed Flynn if he was the last man in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd 'nough sight better marry me,&rdquo; said
Dennison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go along; you're fooling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I ain't. I mean it, honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want to marry anybody yet awhile,&rdquo; said
Nellie Stone; but when Dennison kissed her again she did not repulse
him, and even nestled her head with a little caressing motion into
the hollow of his shoulder.</p>

<p>Then they both started violently apart as Flynn entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he proclaimed, &ldquo;what do you think? The
boss has just told the hands that he'll split the difference and
reduce the wages five instead of ten per cent.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LIX</h3>

<p>When Robert Lloyd entered the factory that morning he experienced
one of those revulsions which come to man in common with all
creation. As the wind can swerve from south to east, and its swerving
be a part of the universal scheme of things, so the inconsistency of
a human soul can be an integral part of its consistency. Robert,
entering Lloyd's, flushed with triumph over his workmen, filled also
with rage whenever he thought of poor Risley, became suddenly, to all
appearances, another man. However, he was the same man, only he had
come under some hidden law of growth. All at once, as he stood there
amidst those whirring and clamping machines, and surveyed those bowed
and patient backs and swaying arms of labor, standing aside to allow
a man bending before a heavy rack of boots to push it to another
department, he realized that his triumph was gone.</p>

<p>Not a man or woman in the factory looked at him. All continued
working with a sort of patient fierceness, as if storming a
citadel&mdash;as, indeed, they were in one sense&mdash;and waging
incessant and in the end hopeless warfare against the destructive
forces of life. Robert stood in the midst of them, these
fellow-beings who had bowed to his will, and saw, as if by some
divine revelation, in his foes his brothers and sisters. He saw
Ellen's fair head before her machine, and she seemed the key-note of
a heart-breaking yet ineffable harmony of creation which he heard for
the first time. He was a man whom triumph did not exalt as much as it
humiliated. Who was he to make these men and women do his bidding?
They were working as hard as they had worked for full pay. Without
doubt he would not gain as much comparatively, but he was going to
lose nothing actually, and he would not work as these men worked. He
saw himself as he never could have seen himself had the strike
continued; and yet, after all, he was not a woman, to be carried away
by a sudden wave of generous sentiment and enthusiasm, for his
business instincts were too strong, inherited and developed by the
force of example. He could not forget that this had been his uncle's
factory.</p>

<p>He shut his mouth hard, and stood looking at the scene of toil,
then he resolved what to do.</p>

<p>He spoke to Flynn, who could not believe his ears, and asked him
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and speak to the engineer, and tell him to shut
down,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain't going to turn them out, after all?&rdquo; gasped
Flynn. He was deadly white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not. I only want to speak to them,&rdquo; replied
Robert, shortly.</p>

<p>When the roar of machinery had ceased, Robert stood before the
employ&eacute;s, whose faces had taken on an expression of murder and
menace. They anticipated the worst by this order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to say to you all,&rdquo; said Robert, in a loud,
clear voice, &ldquo;that I realize it will be hard for you to make
both ends meet with the cut of ten per cent. I will make it five
instead of ten per cent., although I shall actually lose by so doing
unless business improves. I will, however, try it as long as
possible. If the hard times continue, and it becomes a sheer
impossibility for me to employ you on these terms without abandoning
the plant altogether, I will approach you again, and trust that you
will support me in any measures I am forced to take. And, on the
contrary, should business improve, I promise that your wages shall be
raise to the former standard at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speech was so straightforward that it sounded almost boyish.
Robert, indeed, looked very young as he stood there, for a generous
and pitying impulse does tend to make a child of a man. The workmen
stared at him a minute, then there was a queer little broken chorus
of &ldquo;Thank ye's,&rdquo; with two or three shrill crows of
cheers.</p>

<p>Robert went from room to room, repeating his short speech, then
work recommenced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's the right sort, after all,&rdquo; said Granville Joy
to John Sargent, and his tone had a quality of heroism in it. He was
very thin and pale. He had suffered privations, and now came
additional worry of mind. He could not help thinking that this might
bring about an understanding between Robert and Ellen, and yet he
paid his spiritual dues at any cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's no more than he ought to do,&rdquo; growled a man at
Granville's right. &ldquo;S'pose he does lose a little
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't many out of the New Testament that are going to
lose a little for the sake of their fellow-men, I can tell you
that,&rdquo; said John Sargent. He was cutting away deftly and
swiftly, and thinking with satisfaction of the money which he would
be able to send his sister, and also how the Atkins family would be
no longer so pinched. He was a man who would never come under the
grindstone of the pessimism of life for his own necessities, but
lately the necessities of others had almost forced him there. Now and
then he glanced across the room at Maria, whose narrow shoulders he
could see bent painfully over her work. He was in love with Maria,
but no one suspected it, least of all Maria herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord! don't talk about the New Testament. Them days is
past,&rdquo; growled the man on the other side of Joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They ain't past for me,&rdquo; said John Sargent, stoutly.
A dark flush rose to his cheek as if he were making a confession of
love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord! don't preach,&rdquo; said the other man, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>Ellen had stopped work with the rest when Robert addressed them.
Then she recommenced her stitching without a word. Her thoughts were
in confusion. She had so long held one attitude towards him that she
could not readily adjust herself to another. She was cramped with the
extreme narrowness of the enthusiasm of youth. At noontime she heard
all the talk which went on about him. She heard some praise him, and
some speak of him as simply doing his manifest duty, and some say
openly that he should have put the wages back upon the former
footing, and she did not know which was right. He did not come near
her, and she was very glad of that. She felt that she could not bear
it to have him speak to her before them all.</p>

<p>When she went home at night the news had preceded her. Fanny and
Andrew looked up eagerly when she entered. &ldquo;I hear he has
compromised,&rdquo; said Andrew, with doubtful eyes on the girl's
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; he has cut the wages five instead of ten per
cent.,&rdquo; replied Ellen, and it was impossible to judge of her
feelings by her voice. She took off her hat and smoothed her
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad he has done that much,&rdquo; said Fanny,
&ldquo;but I won't say a word as long as you ain't hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that she went into the kitchen, and Ellen and Andrew heard
the dishes rattle. &ldquo;Your mother's been dreadful nervous,&rdquo;
whispered Andrew. He looked at Ellen meaningly. Both of them thought
of poor Eva Tenny. Lately the reports with regard to her had been
more encouraging, but she was still in the asylum.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they stood there, a swift shadow passed the window,
and they heard a shrill scream from up-stairs. It sounded like
&ldquo;Mamma, mamma!&rdquo;  &ldquo;It's Amabel!&rdquo; cried Ellen.
She clutched her father by the arm. &ldquo;Oh, what is it&mdash;who
is it?&rdquo; she whispered, fearfully.</p>

<p>Andrew was suddenly white and horror-stricken. He took hold of
Ellen, and pushed her forcibly before him into the parlor. &ldquo;You
stay in there till I call you,&rdquo; he said, in a commanding voice,
the like of which the girl had never heard from him before; then he
shut the door, and she heard the key turn in the lock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, I can't stay in here,&rdquo; cried Ellen. She ran
towards the other door into the front hall, but before she could
reach it she heard the key turn in that also. Andrew was convinced
that Eva had escaped from the asylum, and thus made sure of Ellen's
safety in case she was violent. Then he rushed out into the kitchen,
and there was Amabel clinging to her mother like a little wild thing,
and Fanny weeping aloud.</p>

<p>When Andrew entered Fanny flew to him. &ldquo;O Andrew&mdash;O
Andrew!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Eva's come out! She's well! she's
cured! She's as well as anybody! She is! She says so, and I know she
is! Only look at her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, mamma!&rdquo; gasped Amabel, in a strange, little,
pent voice, which did not sound like a child's. There was something
fairly inhuman about it. &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; as she said it, did not
sound like a word in any known language. It was like a cry of
universal childhood for its parent. Amabel clung to her mother, not
only with her slender little arms, but with her legs and breast and
neck; all her slim body became as a vine with tendrils of love and
growth around her mother.</p>

<p>As for Eva, she could not have enough of her. She was intoxicated
with the possession of this little creature of her own flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's grown; she's grown so tall,&rdquo; she said, in a
high, panting voice. It was all she could seem to realize&mdash;the
fact that the child had grown so tall&mdash;and it filled her at once
with ineffable pain and delight. She held the little thing so close
to her that the two seemed fairly one. &ldquo;Mamma, mamma!&rdquo;
said Amabel again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has&mdash;grown so tall,&rdquo; panted Eva.</p>

<p>Fanny went up to her and tried gently to loosen her grasp of the
little girl. In her heart she was not yet quite sure of her. This
fierceness of delight began to alarm her. &ldquo;Of course she has
grown tall, Eva Tenny,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's quite a while
since you were&mdash;taken sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't sick now,&rdquo; said Eva, in a steady voice.
&ldquo;I'm cured now. The doctors say so. You needn't be afraid,
Fanny Brewster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, mamma!&rdquo; said Amabel. Eva bent down and kissed
the little, delicate face; then she looked at her sister and at
Andrew, and her own countenance seemed fairly illuminated. &ldquo;I
'ain't <em>told</em> you all,&rdquo; said she. Then she stopped and
hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Eva?&rdquo; asked Fanny, looking at her with
increasing courage. The tears were streaming openly down her cheeks.
&ldquo;Oh, you poor girl, what have you been through?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'ain't got to go through anything more,&rdquo; said Eva,
still with that rapt look over Amabel's little, fair head.
&ldquo;He's&mdash;come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva Tenny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; Eva went on, with such an air of
inexpressible triumph that it had almost a religious quality in it.
&ldquo;He has. He left her a long time ago. He&mdash;he wanted to
come back to me and Amabel, but he was ashamed, but finally he came
to the asylum, and then it all rolled off, all the trouble. The
doctors said I had been getting better, but they didn't know. It
was&mdash;Jim's comin' back. He's took me home, and I've come for
Amabel, and&mdash;he's got a job in Lloyd's, and he's bought me this
new hat and cape.&rdquo;  Eva flirted her free arm, and a sweep of
jetted silk gleamed, then she tossed her head consciously to display
a hat with a knot of pink roses. Then she kissed Amabel again.
&ldquo;Mamma's come back,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, mamma!&rdquo; cried Amabel.</p>

<p>Andrew and Fanny looked at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Andrew, in a slow, halting
voice.</p>

<p>Eva glanced from one to the other defiantly. &ldquo;He's outside,
waitin' in the road,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but he ain't comin' in
unless you treat him just the same as ever. I've set my veto on
that.&rdquo;  Eva's voice and manner as she said that were so
unmistakably her own that all Fanny's doubt of her sanity vanished.
She sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God, I'm so thankful! She's come home, and she's all
right! O God, I'm so thankful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Jim?&rdquo; asked Eva, with her old, proud,
defiant look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he's comin' in,&rdquo; sobbed Fanny.
&ldquo;Andrew, you go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Andrew had already gone, unlocking the parlor door on his way.
&ldquo;It's your aunt Eva, Ellen,&rdquo; he said as he passed.
&ldquo;She's come home cured, and your uncle Jim is out in the yard,
and I'm goin' to call him in. I guess you'd better go out and see
her.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LX</h3>

<p>Lloyd's had been running for two months, and spring had fairly
begun. It was a very forward season. The elms were leafed out, the
cherry and peach blossoms had fallen, and the apple-trees were in
full flower. There were many orchards around Rowe. The little city
was surrounded with bowing garlands of tenderest white and rose, the
well-kept lawns in the city limits were like velvet, and
golden-spiked bushes and pink trails of flowering almond were beside
the gates. Lilacs also, flushed with rose, purpled the walls of old
houses. One morning Ellen, on her way to the factory, had for the
first time that year a realization of the full presence of the
spring. All at once she knew the goddess to be there in her whole
glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spring has really come,&rdquo; she said to Abby. As she
spoke she jostled a great bush of white flowers, growing in a yard
close to the sidewalk, and an overpowering fragrance, like a very
retaliation of sweetness, came in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Abby; &ldquo;it seems more like spring
than it did last night, somehow!&rdquo;  Abby had gained flesh, and
there was a soft color on her cheeks, so that she was almost pretty,
as she glanced abroad with a sort of bright gladness and a face ready
with smiles. Maria also looked in better health than she had done in
the winter. She walked with her arm through Ellen's.</p>

<p>Suddenly a carriage, driven rapidly, passed them, and Cynthia
Lennox's graceful profile showed like a drooping white flower in a
window.</p>

<p>Sadie Peel came up to them with a swift run. &ldquo;Say!&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;know who that was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've got eyes,&rdquo; replied Abby Atkins, shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said you hadn't? You needn't be so up an' comin', Abby
Atkins; I didn't know as you knew they were married, that's all. I
just heard it from Lottie Snell, whose sister works at the
dressmaker's that made the wedding fix. Weddin' fix! My land! Think
of a weddin' without a white dress and a veil! All she had was a gray
silk and a black velvet, and a black lace, and a
travellin'-dress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby Atkins eyed the other girl sharply, her curiosity getting the
better of her dislike. &ldquo;Who did she marry?&rdquo; said she,
shortly. &ldquo;I suppose she didn't marry the black velvet, or the
lace, or the travelling-dress. That's all you seem to think
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>thought</em> you didn't know,&rdquo; replied Sadie
Peel, in a tone of triumph. &ldquo;They've kept it mighty still, and
he's been goin' there so long, ever since anybody can remember, that
they didn't think it was anything more now than it had been right
along. Lyman Risley and Cynthia Lennox have just got married, and
they've gone down to Old Point Comfort. My land, it's nice to have
money, if you be half blind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked after the retreating carriage, and made no
comment.</p>

<p>She was pale and thin, and moved with a certain languor, although
she held up her head proudly, and when people asked if she were not
well, answered quickly that she had never been better. Robert had not
been to see her yet. She had furtively watched for him a long time,
then she had given it up. She would not acknowledge to herself or any
one else that she was not well or was troubled in spirit. Her courage
was quite equal to the demand upon it, yet always she was aware of a
peculiar sensitiveness to all happenings, whether directly concerned
with herself or not, which made life an agony to her, and she knew
that her physical strength was not what it had been. Only that
morning she had looked at her face in the glass, and had seen how it
was altered. The lovely color was gone from her cheeks, there were
little, faint, downward lines about her mouth, and, more than that,
out of her blue eyes looked the eternal, unanswerable question of
humanity, &ldquo;Where is my happiness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to her when she first set out that she could not walk to
the factory. That sense of the full presence of the spring seemed to
overpower her. All the revelation of beauty and sweetness seemed a
refinement of torture worse to bear than the sight of death and
misery would have been. Every blooming apple-bough seemed to strike
her full on the heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only look at that bush of red flowers in that yard,&rdquo;
Maria said once, and Ellen looked and was stung by the sight as by
the contact of a red flaming torch of spring. &ldquo;What ails you,
dear; don't you like those flowers?&rdquo; Maria said, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I do; I think they are lovely,&rdquo;
replied Ellen, looking.</p>

<p>She looked after the carriage which contained the bridal party;
she thought how the bridegroom had almost lost his eyesight to save
her, and her old adoration of Cynthia seemed to rise to a flood-tide.
Then came the thought of Robert, how he must have ceased to love
her&mdash;how some day he would be starting off on a bridal trip of
his own. Maud Hemingway, with whom she had often coupled him in her
thoughts, seemed to start up before her, all dressed in bridal white.
It seemed to her that she could not bear it all. She continued
walking, but she did not feel the ground beneath her feet, nor even
Maria's little, clinging fingers of tenderness on her arm. She became
to her own understanding like an instrument which is played upon with
such results of harmonies and discords that all sense of the
mechanism is lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ellen Brewster,&rdquo; said Sadie Peel, in her loud,
strident voice, &ldquo;I guess you wouldn't have been walkin' along
here quite so fine this mornin' if it hadn't been for Mr. Risley.
You'd ought to send him a weddin'-present&mdash;a spoon, or
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; said Abby Atkins; &ldquo;Ellen has worried
herself sick over him as it is.&rdquo;  She eyed Ellen anxiously as
she spoke. Maria clung more closely to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up yourself, Abby Atkins,&rdquo; returned Sadie Peel.
&ldquo;He's got a wife to lead him around, and I don't see much to
worry about. A great weddin'! My goodness, if I don't get married
when I'm young enough to wear a white dress and veil, catch me
gettin' married at all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sadie Peel sped on with her news to a group of girls ahead, and
the wheels of the carriage flashed out of sight in the spring
sunlight. It was quite true that Risley and Cynthia had been married
that morning. He had not entirely lost his vision, although it would
always be poor, and he would live happily, although in a measure
disappointedly, feeling that his partial helplessness was his chief
claim upon his wife's affection. He had gotten what he had longed for
for so many years, but by means which tended to his humiliation
instead of his pride. But Cynthia was radiant. In caring for her
half-blind husband she attained the spiritual mountain height of her
life. She possessed love in the one guise in which he appealed to
her, and she held him fast to the illumination of her very soul.</p>

<p>After the carriage had passed out of sight Abby came close on the
other side of Ellen and slid her arm through hers. &ldquo;Say!&rdquo;
she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Ellen.</p>

<p>Abby blushed. &ldquo;Oh, nothing much,&rdquo; she replied, in a
tone unusual for her. She took her arm away from Ellen's, and laughed
a little foolishly.</p>

<p>Ellen stared at her with grave wonder. She had not the least idea
what she meant.</p>

<p>Abby changed the subject. &ldquo;Going to the park opening
to-night, Ellen?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better. Do go, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do go, Ellen; it will do you good,&rdquo; said Maria.
She looked into Ellen's face with the inexpressibly pure love of one
innocent girl for another.</p>

<p>The park was a large grove of oaks and birch-trees which had
recently been purchased by the street railway company of Rowe, and it
was to be used for the free entertainment of the people, with an
undercurrent of consideration for the financial profit of the
company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid I can't go,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can; it will do you good; you look like a ghost
this morning,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do go, Ellen,&rdquo; pleaded Maria.</p>

<p>However, Ellen would not have gone had it not been for a whisper
of Abby's as they came out of the factory that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ellen, you'd better go,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;just to show folks. That Sadie Peel asked me this noon if it
was true that you had something on your mind, and was worrying
about&mdash;well, you know what&mdash;that made you look
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen flushed an angry red. &ldquo;I'll stop for you and Maria
to-night,&rdquo; she answered, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Abby replied, heartily; &ldquo;we'll go
on the eight-o'clock car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen hurried home, and changed her dress after supper, putting on
her new green silk waist and her spring hat, which was trimmed with
roses. When she went down-stairs, and told her mother where she was
going, she started up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare, I'd go too if your father had come home,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I don't know when I've been anywhere; and Eva was in
this afternoon and said that she and Jim were going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder where father is?&rdquo; said Ellen, uneasily.
&ldquo;I don't know as I ought to go till he comes home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stuff!&rdquo; replied Fanny. &ldquo;He's stopped to
talk at the store. Oh, here he is now. Andrew Brewster, where in the
world have you been?&rdquo; she began as he entered; but his mother
was following him, and something in their faces stopped her. Fanny
Brewster had lived for years with this man, but never before had she
seen his face with just that expression of utter, unreserved joy;
although joy was scarcely the word for it, for it was more than that.
It was the look of a man who has advanced to his true measure of
growth, and regained self-respect which he had lost. All the abject
bend of his aging back, all the apologetic patience of his outlook,
was gone. She stared at him, hardly believing her eyes. She was as
frightened as if he had looked despairing instead of joyful.
&ldquo;Andrew Brewster, what is it?&rdquo; she asked. She tried to
smile, to echo the foolish width of grimace on his face, but her lips
were too stiff.</p>

<p>Ellen looked at him, trembling, and very white under her knot of
roses. Andrew held out a paper and tried to speak, but he could
not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God's sake, what is it?&rdquo; gasped Fanny.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Zelotes spoke. &ldquo;That old mining-stock has come
up,&rdquo; said she, in a harsh voice. &ldquo;He'd never ought to
have bought it. I should have told him better if he had asked me, but
it's come up, and it's worth considerable more than he paid for it.
I've just been down to Mrs. Pointdexter's, and Lawyer Samson was in
there seeing her about a bond she's got that's run out, and he says
the mine's going to pay dividends, and for Andrew to hold on to part
of it, anyhow. I bought this paper, and it's in it. He never ought to
have bought it, but it's come up. I hope it will learn him a lesson.
He's had enough trouble over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the mixture of recrimination and exultation
with which the old woman spoke. She eyed Fanny accusingly; she looked
at Andrew with grudging triumph. &ldquo;Lawyer Samson says it will
make him rich, he guesses; at any rate, he'll come out whole,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;I hope it will learn you a lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew dropped into a chair. His face was distended with a foolish
smile like a baby's. He seemed to smile at all creation. He looked at
his wife and Ellen; then his face again took on its expression of
joyful vacuity.</p>

<p>Fanny went close to him and laid a firm hand on his shoulder.
&ldquo;You 'ain't had a mite of supper, Andrew Brewster,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;come right out and have something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew shook his head, still smiling. His wife and daughter looked
at him alarmedly, then at each other. Then his mother went behind
him, laid a hard, old hand on each shoulder, and shook him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you <em>have</em> got a streak of luck, there's no need
of your actin' like a fool about it, Andrew Brewster,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;Go out and eat your supper, and behave yourself, and let
it be a lesson to you. There you had worked and saved that little
money you had in the bank, and you bought an old mine with it, and it
might have turned out there wasn't a thing in it, no mine at all, and
there was. Just let it be a lesson to you, that's all; and go out and
eat your supper, and don't be too set up over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew looked at his wife and mother and daughter, still with that
expression of joy, so unreserved that it was almost idiotic. They had
all stood by him loyally; he had their fullest sympathy; but had one
of them fully understood? Not one of them could certainly understand
what was then passing in his mind, which had been straitened by grief
and self-reproach, and was now expanding to hold its full measure of
joy. That poor little sum in the bank, that accumulation of his hard
earnings, which he had lost through his own bad judgment, had meant
much more than itself to him, both in its loss and its recovery. It
was more than money; it was the value of money in the current coin of
his own self-respect.</p>

<p>His mother shook him again, but rather gently. &ldquo;Get up this
minute, and go out and eat your supper,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and
then I don't see why you can't go with Fanny and me to the park
opening. They say lots of folks are goin', and there's goin' to be
fireworks. It'll distract your mind. It ain't safe for anybody to
dwell too much on good luck any more than on misfortune. Go right out
and eat your supper; it's most time for the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew obeyed.</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter LXI</h3>

<p>The new park, which had been named, in honor of the president of
the street railway company, Clemens Park, was composed of a light
growth of oak and birch trees. With the light of the full moon, like
a broadside of silvery arrows, and the frequent electric-lights
filtering through the young, delicate foliage, it was much more
effective than a grove of pine or hemlock would have been.</p>

<p>When the people streamed into it from the crowded electric-cars,
there were exclamations of rapture. Women and girls fairly shrieked
with delight. The ground, which had been entirely cleared of
undergrowth, was like an etching in clearest black and white, of the
tender dancing foliage of the oaks and birches. The birches stood
together in leaning, white-limbed groups like maidens, and the
rustling spread of the oaks shed broad flashes of silver from the
moon. In the midst of the grove the Hungarian orchestra played in a
pavilion, and dancing was going on there. Many of the people outside
moved with dancing steps. Children in swings flew through the airs
with squeals of delight. There was a stand for the sale of ice-cream
and soda, and pretty girls blossomed like flowers behind the
counters. There were various rustic adornments, such as seats and
grottos, and at one end of the grove was a small collection of wild
animals in cages, and a little artificial pond with swans. Now and
then, above the chatter of the people and the music of the orchestra,
sounded the growl of a bear or the shrill screech of a paroquet, and
the people all stopped and listened and laughed. This little
titillation of the unusual in the midst of their sober walk of life
affected them like champagne. Most of them were of the poorer and
middle classes, the employ&eacute;s of the factories of Rowe. They
moved back and forth with dancing steps of exultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, ain't it beautiful!&rdquo; Fanny said, squeezing
Andrew's arm. He had his wife on one arm, his mother on the other.
For him the whole scene appeared more than it really was, since it
reflected the joy of his own soul. There was for him a light greater
than that of the moon or electricity upon it&mdash;that extreme light
of the world&mdash;the happiness of a human being who blesses in a
moment of prosperity the hour he was born. He knew for the first time
in his life that happiness is as true as misery, and no mere creation
of a fairy tale. No trees of the Garden of Eden could have outshone
for him those oaks and birches. No gold or precious stones of any
mines on earth can equal the light of the little star of happiness in
one human soul.</p>

<p>Fanny, as they walked along, kept looking at her husband, and her
own face was transfigured. Mrs. Zelotes, also, seemed to radiate with
a sort of harsh and prickly delight. She descanted upon the
hard-earned savings which Andrew had risked, but she held her old
head very high with reluctant joy, and her bonnet had a rakish
cant.</p>

<p>Ellen, with Abby and Maria, walked behind them.</p>

<p>Presently Andrew met another man who had also purchased stock in
the mine, and stopped to exchange congratulations. The man's face was
flushed, as if he had been drinking, but he had not. On his arm hung
his wife, a young woman with a showy red waist and some pink ribbon
bows on her hat. She was teetering a little in time to the music,
while a little girl clung to her skirts and teetered also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old man,&rdquo; said the new-comer, with a hoarse
sound in his throat, &ldquo;they needn't talk to us any more, need
they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; replied Andrew, but his joy in prosperity
was not like the other man's. It placed him heights above him,
although from the same cause. Prosperity means one thing to one man,
and another to his brother.</p>

<p>Presently they met Jim Tenny and Eva and Amabel. They were walking
three abreast, Amabel in the middle. Jim Tenny looked hesitatingly at
them, although his face was widened with irrepressible smiles. Eva
gazed at them with defiant radiance. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;so luck has turned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amabel laughed out, and her laugh trilled high with a note of
silver, above the chatter of the crowd and the blare and rhythmic
trill of the orchestra. &ldquo;I've had an ice-cream, and I'm going
to have a new doll and a doll-carriage,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Oh,
Ellen!&rdquo;  She left her father and mother for a second and clung
to Ellen, kissing her; then she was back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Andrew?&rdquo; said Jim. He had a shamed face, yet
there was something brave in it struggling for expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim?&rdquo; said Andrew.</p>

<p>The two shook hands solemnly. Then they walked on together, and
the sisters behind, with Amabel clinging to her mother's hand.
&ldquo;Jim's goin' to work if he <em>has</em> had a little
windfall,&rdquo; said Eva, proudly. &ldquo;Oh, Fanny, only think what
it means!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be a lesson to both of them,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Zelotes, stalking along after, but she smiled harshly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, land, don't croak, if you've got a chance to laugh!
There's few enough chances in this world,&rdquo; cried Eva, with
boisterous good humor. &ldquo;As for me, I've come out of deep
waters, and I'm goin' to take what comfort I can in the feel of the
solid ground under my feet.&rdquo;  She began to force Amabel into a
dance in time with the music, and the child shrieked with
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S'pose she's all right?&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Zelotes to
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land, yes,&rdquo; replied Fanny; &ldquo;it's just like her,
just the way she used to do. It makes me surer than anything else
that she's cured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls behind were loitering. Abby turned to Ellen and pointed
to a rustic seat under a clump of birches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's sit down there a minute, Ellen,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Ellen. When she and Abby seated
themselves, Maria withdrew, standing aloof under an oak, looking up
at the illumined spread of branches with the rapt, innocent
expression of a saint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you come and sit down with us, Maria?&rdquo;
Ellen called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a minute,&rdquo; replied Maria, in her weak, sweet
voice. Then John Sargent came up and joined her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She'll come in a minute,&rdquo; Abby said to Ellen.
&ldquo;She&mdash;she&mdash;knows I want to tell you
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby hesitated. Ellen regarded her with wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ellen,&rdquo; said Abby; &ldquo;I don't know
what you're going to think of me after all I've said, but&mdash;I'm
going to get married to Willy Jones. His mother has had a little
money left her, and she owns the house clear now, and I'm going to
keep right on working; and&mdash;I never thought I would, Ellen, you
know; but I've come to think lately that all you can get out of labor
in this world is the happiness it brings you, and&mdash;the love.
That's more than the money, and&mdash;he wants me pretty bad. I
suppose you think I'm awful, Ellen Brewster.&rdquo;  Abby spoke with
triumph, yet with shame. She dug her little toe into the
shadow-mottled ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Abby, I hope you'll be real happy,&rdquo; said Ellen.
Then she choked a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've made up my mind not to work for nothing,&rdquo; said
Abby; &ldquo;I've made up my mind to get whatever work is worth in
this world if I can, and&mdash;to get it for him too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will be very happy,&rdquo; said Ellen again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is now,&rdquo; whispered Abby. She rose as Willy
Jones approached, laughing confusedly. &ldquo;I've been telling Ellen
Brewster,&rdquo; said Abby, with her perfunctory air.</p>

<p>Ellen held out her hand, and Willy Jones grasped it, then let it
drop and muttered something. He looked with helpless adoration at
Abby, who put her hand through his arm reassuringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's go and see the animals,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I
haven't seen the animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I'll go and see if I can find my father and
mother,&rdquo; returned Ellen. &ldquo;I want to see my mother about
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come with us.&rdquo;  Abby grasped Ellen firmly around
the waist and kissed her. &ldquo;I don't love him a mite better than
I do you,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;so there! You needn't think
you're left out, Ellen Brewster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; replied Ellen. She tried to laugh, but she
felt her lips stiff. And unconquerable feeling of desolation was
coming over her, and in spite of herself her tone was somewhat like
that of a child who sees another with all the cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Floretta got married last night,&rdquo;
said Abby, moving off with Willy Jones. John Sargent and Maria had
long since disappeared from under the oak.</p>

<p>Ellen, left alone, looked for a minute after Abby and Willy, and
noted the tender lean of the girl's head towards the young man's
shoulder; then she started off to find her father and mother. She
could not rid herself of the sense of desolation. She felt blindly
that if she could not get under the shelter of her own loves of life
she could not bear it any longer. She had borne up bravely under
Robert's neglect, but now all at once, with the sight of the
happiness of these others before her eyes, it seemed to crush her.
All the spirit in her seemed to flag and faint. She was only a young
girl, who would fall to the ground and be slain by the awful law of
gravitation of the spirit without love. &ldquo;Anyway, I've got
father and mother,&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>

<p>She rushed on alone through the merry crowd. The orchestra was
playing a medley. The violins seemed to fairly pierce thought. A
Roman-candle burst forth on the right with a great spluttering, and
the people, shrieking with delight, rushed in that direction. Then a
rocket shot high in the air with a splendid curve, and there was a
sea of faces watching with speechless admiration the dropping stars
of violet and gold and rose.</p>

<p>Ellen kept on, moving as nearly as she could in the direction in
which her party had gone. Then suddenly she came face to face with
Robert Lloyd.</p>

<p>She would have passed him without a word, but he stood before
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you speak to me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Lloyd,&rdquo; returned Ellen.</p>

<p>Then she tried to move on again, but Robert still stood before
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to say something to you,&rdquo; he said, in a low
voice. &ldquo;I was coming to your house to-night, but I saw you on
the car. Please come to that seat over there. There is nobody in that
direction. They will all go towards the fireworks now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen looked at him hesitatingly. At that moment she seemed to
throw out protecting antenn&aelig; of maidenliness; and, besides,
there was always the memory of the cut in wages, for which she still
judged him; and then there was the long neglect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please come,&rdquo; said Robert. He looked at her at once
like a conqueror and a pleading child. Ellen placed her hand on his
arm, and they went to the seat under the clump of birches. They were
quite alone, for the whole great company was streaming towards the
fireworks. A fiery wheel was revolving in the distance, and rockets
shot up, dropping showers of stars. Ellen gazed at them without
seeing them at all.</p>

<p>Robert, seated beside her, looked at her earnestly. &ldquo;I am
going to put back the wages on the old basis to-morrow,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Ellen made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business has so improved that I feel justified in doing
so,&rdquo; said Robert. His tone was almost apologetic. Never as long
as he lived would he be able to look at such matters from quite the
same standpoint as that of the girl beside him. She knew that, and
yet she loved him. She never would get his point of view, and yet he
loved her. &ldquo;I have waited until I was able to do that before
speaking to you again,&rdquo; said Robert. &ldquo;I knew how you felt
about the wage-cutting. I thought when matters were back on the old
basis that you might feel differently towards me. God knows I have
been sorry enough for it all, and I am glad enough to be able to pay
them full wages again. And now, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been a long time,&rdquo; said Ellen, looking at her
little hands, clasped in her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have loved you all the time, and I have only waited for
that,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>

<p><br>Later on Robert and Ellen joined Fanny and the others. It was
scarcely the place to make an announcement. After a few words of
greeting the young couple walked off together, and left the Brewsters
and Tennys and Mrs. Zelotes standing on the outskirts of the crowd
watching the fireworks. Granville Joy stood near them. He had looked
at Robert and Ellen with a white face, then he turned again towards
the fireworks with a gentle, heroic expression. He caught up Amabel
that she might see the set piece which was just being put up.
&ldquo;Now you can see, Sissy,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Eva looked away from the fireworks after the retreating pair, then
meaningly at Fanny and Andrew. &ldquo;That's settled,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>Andrew's face quivered a little, and took on something of the same
look which Granville Joy's wore. All love is at the expense of love,
and calls for heroes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It'll be a great thing for her,&rdquo; said Fanny, in his
ear; &ldquo;it'll be a splendid thing for her, you know that,
Andrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew gazed after the nodding roses on Ellen's hat vanishing
towards the right. Another rocket shot up, and the people cried out,
and watched the shower of stars with breathless enjoyment. Andrew saw
their upturned faces, in which for the while toil and trial were
blotted out by that delight in beauty and innocent pleasure of the
passing moment which is, for human souls, akin to the refreshing
showers for flowers of spring; and to him, since his own vision was
made clear by his happiness, came a mighty realization of it all,
which was beyond it all. Another rocket described a wonderful golden
curve of grace, then a red light lit all the watching people. Andrew
looked for Ellen and Robert, and saw the girl's beautiful face
turning backward over her lover's shoulder. All his life Andrew had
been a reader of the Bible, as had his father and mother before him.
To-day, ever since he had heard of his good fortune, his mind had
dwelt upon certain verses of Ecclesiastes. Now he quoted from them.
&ldquo;Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
the life of thy vanity, which He hath given thee under the sun, all
the days of thy vanity, for that is thy portion in this life and in
thy labor which thou takest under the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen saw her father, and smiled and nodded, then she and her
lover passed out of sight. Another rocket trailed its golden parabola
along the sky, and dropped with stars; there was an ineffably sweet
strain from the orchestra; the illuminated oaks tossed silver and
golden boughs in a gust of fragrant wind. Andrew quoted again from
the old King of Wisdom&mdash;&ldquo;I withheld not my heart from any
joy, for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and that was my portion
of labor.&rdquo;  Then Andrew thought of the hard winter which had
passed, as all hard things must pass, of the toilsome lives of those
beside him, of all the work which they had done with their poor,
knotted hands, of the tracks which they had worn on the earth towards
their graves, with their weary feet, and suddenly he seemed to grasp
a new and further meaning for that verse of Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p>He seemed to see that labor is not alone for itself, not for what
it accomplishes of the tasks of the world, not for its equivalent in
silver and gold, not even for the end of human happiness and love,
but for the growth in character of the laborer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the portion of labor,&rdquo; he said. He spoke in a
strained, solemn voice, as he had done before. Nobody heard him
except his wife and mother. His mother gave a sidewise glance at him,
then she folded her cape tightly around her and stared at the
fireworks, but Fanny put her hand through his arm and leaned her
cheek against his shoulder.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
